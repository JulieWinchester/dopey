        <p>It's a bright, sunny, breezy day on the sword coast. It's midmorning, and a trio of travelers are sitting around a cooking fire, with a loaded ox-driven wagon a short distance away. Chappy Quickstep, a halfling in conspicuously new travel leathers, is taking freshly cooked food off the fire. Bounty of Nonsense, a tabaxi in fancy clothing, is reclining prone on his back. And Friendly, a firbolg in simple homespun, is sitting down, munching oats and occasionally offering some to her cow companion. Bount and Friendly chat happily, while Chappy grouses both about wanting to get this job over with and having to endure the gentle teasing of the other two. Eventually the three decide to pack up and move on, Friendly conscientiously ensuring she and her "new friends" leave no trace. They are traveling south down the High Road from Neverwinter to parts south, en route to the frontier town of Phandalin on a job to deliver some supplies for a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker and a human named Silder Hallwinter. They are about half a day out from their destination.</p>
        <p>Heading north on that same high road are two horses, slowly ambling their way along the road. Riding the horses are the tiefling Nyoma Izarren, dressed in teal and gray, and the dragonborn Prexijandilin Pandjet, sporting shining heavy armor and a visibly-displayed shield. Nyoma enthusiastically tries to draw Pandjet into conversation, though as in the previous days of their journey he continues to be relatively taciturn. They have been traveling for weeks, journeying up from the region of Candlekeep and Baldur's Gate on errands toward Phandelin. They have already had their fair share of trouble and unusual events on the road. About midday, they turn eastward onto the Triboar trail which will take them to their rough and tumble destination. The road becomes twisty, and begins to climb into hills that will eventually rise to form the Sword Mountains. Shortly after taking the turn, Pandjet and Nyoma notice a wagon just a short way behind them, moving in the same direction at roughly the same speed. The duo on horseback and the trio on the wagon share genial waves at a distance from each other. Their journey proceeds like this for an hour or so, before they turn a corner and are confronted with the unmistakable sight of two dead horses a hundred yards up the trail.</p>
        <p>The duo halt their horses and study the scene. A ways up the road, the trail narrows with two sharp escarpments topped with trees leaning in on both sides. The two dead horses are laid out on the tightest part of the path, decorated with numerous arrows apiece. Squinting ahead, Pandjet is able to pick out several figures only slightly hidden among the trees of the ridges. Nyoma suggests they wait for the wagon behind, to potentially have a bit more support for what lies ahead. Pandjet is concerned as to what those behind could want, but they agree to wait. The trio in the wagon approaches, and friendly greetings are shared on both sides. Friendly and friends seem more than willing to help navigate the (only slightly) hidden lurkers ahead, and the five together travel forward, with the wagon taking the lead. Bount climbs the escarpment on the left side and begins shadowing the main group as they proceed, taking cover in the underbrush.</p>
        <p>Approaching the narrow point of the path, the three in the wagon and the two on horseback are met by a collection of goblins in simple brown and white uniforms, each with what looks like a shoulder patch insignia of a pair of jaws with sharp, jagged teeth. One goblin in particular, a woman with an abrasive personality and eyes that dart from place to place (who the party will later learn is named Clash), approaches the group and serves as the representative for the others hiding among the trees. She demands the group's traveling papers. An argument ensues in which various characters express incredulity about any need for papers and question exactly where these goblins came from. Clash informs them they are soldiers in the Cragmaw Auxiliary, a military force invited to the area by "responsible authorities" to assert law and order on this "backwards and chaotic" region. Nyoma tries to talk reason with the goblins, Friendly confusedly mocks them for their demands, and Chappy seems baffled about the goblin's literateness. The argument increases swiftly in tension, without any progress being made.</p>
        <p>While the rest of the group argues with the Cragmaw soldiers, Bount ascends a tree near the narrow point, where a goblin has taken up a post among the branches with a shortbow trained on the individuals below. Moving swiftly as a breeze, the tabaxi is able to place himself directly behind the solder in the tree, and he claps his hand over the goblin's mouth while threatening aggressively with the guard of his sword. Bounty hisses, "I will end you unless you stop your friends down there – right now. Drop your weapon." The soldier dutifully nods agreement, and drops his weapon. Unfortunately, as they are in a tree, this produces an awful racket as the bow and arrows clatter noisily from branch to branch on their way to the ground. Clash orders the remaining goblins to attack! A noisy confusing melee results. By the time the dust clears, Bount has knocked the goblin in the tree out and to the ground with the guard of his sword, Chappy has strummed sorcerous chords on her lute to lull two of the soldiers into unconsciousness, and a combination of vines summoned by Friendly and a threatened burst of sidereal energy held in the hand of Nyoma force Clash to surrender on behalf of her troops, given she is the only one remaining conscious.</p>
        <p>With some hesitation, Clash agrees to tell the party anything they want to know. She informs them she is the sergeant of this group of goblins, and they were provided orders to specifically detain Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter and hand them over to someone known as the "Black Spider." Her last understanding was that they had been taken to the local unit encampment, located in a cave five miles northwest, shortly to be moved to their company headquarters at Cragmaw Castle north of Phandelin inside Neverwinter Wood. After some additional questioning, she also reveals the presence of traps along the route. Bount rifles through her pockets discretely, and comes up with a crude handwritten map which he secrets away from the other characters. Friendly forces her to write them authorized travel papers to hopefully avoid this situation again. The five then debate whether or not to travel to the cave HQ or to Phandelin. Pandjet initially seems hesitant, but is convinced by Nyoma and the others to attempt to rescue the hostages. The group sets out northwest.</p>
        <p>Despite his initial hesitation about the detour, Pandjet confidently takes point and leads the group through the briar patches and copses of trees on the way to their destination. While they travel this way, Bount shows Friendly the map he found, and specifically the worrying room on the map marked "The Weapon." Friendly is less subtle about the secret map than the tabaxi would otherwise like. Unfortunately for Pandjet, for his assertiveness he is paid back by being caught in a snare trap two miles into the hike, though thankfully he ends up unharmed. After this and a comment by Bounty of Nonsense that he has some experience with traps, the others side-eye Bount into taking point. A short while later, he trips the second and final expected hazard, a pit trap, but his agility allows him to sidestep actually being caught in it.</p>
        <p>Shortly after, the five reach a sharply ascending hill with a large opening, with two large banners bearing the Cragmaw emblem on them. Out of the opening flows a narrow shallow stream. Here the group encounters two goblin soldiers standing guard - they yell "Who goes there!" in the midst of the group's debating on a plan of action. Thinking on her feet, Friendly responds they have arrived to take the prisoners to the Black Spider. The guards seem confused, as one of the prisoners has already been transferred! But the group is able to soothe things over and win the trust of the guards. One of the guards escorts them to meet with Yenniw, the corporal and superior officer of this Auxiliary Unit. As they snake their way inside, bordering the stream and climbing a number of stairs as the cave ascends inside the hill, Bounty of Nonsense trails behind. He spots a small set of stairs leading up into the room marked on the map as holding the Weapon, and his curiosity gets the better of him. He blusters and bluffs about needing to check that the entire Unit operations are in ship-shape, and the rest of the group moves on without him, heading around and over a bridge spanning the stream into the large relatively comfortable quarters of the goblins.</p>
        <p>The remaining four encounter Yenniw in the large, warm, and well-lit living space of the goblins. He is seated at his desk on an upper level of the room, furiously scribbling away at papers. Yenniw has a slick, mean grin on his face and is generally corpulent. They also spot a prone unmoving human-sized figure half-hidden behind a stalagmite, also on the upper level. Friendly takes the lead and reasserts to Yenniw that the group is here to take the prisoner to the Black Spider. The corporal seems quite surprised at this, and replies that he was not aware of any prisoner transfer taking place. Friendly bluffs that there must be something seriously amiss if the Spider is issuing orders through Clash now rather than Yenniw, and that it would be in the corporal's best interest not to anger their shared superior further. Yenniw studies them for a while, but it is not long before his standard sly grin returns to his face. He returns to the group, gripping the edges of his desk with his fingers (moving his finger to press a button on the underside unnoticed by anyone), and informs the group that he will help them out by letting them take the prisoner, if they help him out by doing a routine check on "the Weapon's containment system." Chappy puts on a show of acting baffled, asking Yenniw, "Do you think this is FUN for us? Just let us do our damn job!" After some more back and forth, he agrees to let them take the prisoner – Sildar Hallwinter, as it turns out – with them on their way to check the containment system. Everyone agrees to this plan.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Bount spends some time making the acquaintance of the guard stationed at the door to the room where the Weapon is supposed to be located. She gives him some ominous sounding instructions, including maintaining a five foot distance, which he readily agrees to before cautiously stepping inside. The room is quite large, and dark to boot. Creeping forward into the dim chamber, Bounty of Nonsense approaches quite close to what turns out to be a large metal cage. Inside the cage is a forlorn-looking wolf pressed against the floor, growling low. But more importantly, also lurking inside is an eight foot tall powerfully-built hairy creature. It is standing upright and leaning forward menacingly, breathing raggedly and with intense glowing red eyes fixed directly on the tabaxi. Bount's mouth falls open, trying to make sense of the scene. But as he takes it all in, a loud metallic click sounds through the room, and a series of gears begin turning. The last of these gears whirrs as it unlocks and swings open the main front door of the cage. The thing inside exhales a low rumbled moan, while the wolf's growl increases in intensity. With a surprisingly smoothness and quietness, the creature that is apparently the weapon lifts a javelin lying nearby the cage and hurls it at Bount before lumbering out of the cage toward him. The tabaxi uses every ounce of his feline reflexes to flee headlong out the room, yelling to the previously chatty goblin guard to run for her life, the weapon has escaped!</p>
        <p>The rest of the group is emerging from the goblin quarters to the bridge over the stream. Sildar was initially confused and hostile toward the seeming allies of the goblins, but Chappy and Nyoma healed and helped the man, and did their best to communicate silently to him that this was a rescue attempt. Yet as the four of them emerge onto the bridge, they encounter Bounty running as fast as he can the other way. "The weapon is a living weapon and it's escaped and we need to leave NOW!" Bount yells, with both the wolf and the creature hot on his heels behind. What comes next is absolute madness, with goblins from the chambers next to the weapon's screaming and fleeing in all directions, and the party trying to get everyone down from the bridge while holding off the wolf and the weapon, both intent on mauling anyone in their path. The weapon skewers Bount with a javelin and he falls unconscious, but is brought back to consciousness by Nyoma. Pandjet moves to protect the others, blocking off the far side of the bridge after Bount flees and Friendly jumps down to the lower level. Pandjet's steadfastness proves true, allowing him to hold the line despite suffering the sharp gnashing jaws of the wolf.</p>
        <p>While Pandjet holds off the slavering canine, Chappy and Nyoma take up position on the bridge behind him. Finally, bleeding and bitten, the dragonborn leaps athletically down from the bridge, clearing the way for the two practitioners of the mystic arts. Nyoma launches bursts of destructive starstuff at the wolf and the weapon, while Chappy unleashes insults and barbs with words that carry the base vibrations of the fabric of reality, unmaking their foes from the inside out. The wolf is finally undone, and the great hairy beast pauses from the onslaught. Seizing the opportunity and newly conscious, Bounty catches the perfect angle and lets loose an arrow from below! The arrow flies fast and lodges itself between the beast's eyes, and with blood streaming down its face, it collapses into a wet muddy heap.</p>
        <p>Friendly with her eight foot stature is able to help everyone still above down from the bridge. The group, now six with rescued hostage Sildar Hallweather in tow, is able to flee at pace out of the cave. They collect their wagon and horses, and safely hightail it away from the scene with the Cragmaw goblins still in total disarray from the violent chaotic scene just moments before.</p>

        <p>Away from the confusion and disarray with the Cragmaw goblins, the wagon is back on the Triboar trial to Phandalin. Bounty of Nonsense, with his fine coat torn and soiled with blood, sits in the wagon along with Silder Hallwinter, badly beaten and with only threadbare clothing to his name. Friendly drives the wagon while Chappy shares the seat up front, and Nyoma and Pandjed parallel the cart on their horses. Sildar coughs a bit of blood into his fist and then, looking up, asks: "What in the world happened back there?" What ensues is a disjointed conversation of non-sequiters, partial explanations, and introductions. Silder and Bount greet each other, having known each other a bit back in Neverwinter, but unusually for the tabaxi, he is unable to carry much of a conversation as he is seriously shaken from the violence he just experienced.</p>
        <p>Sildar explains he and Gundren set out from Neverwinter some days ago and made fine time, but were set upon by the goblins and ambushed. He does not know where Gundren was taken. Everyone else but Bount chips in to tell the story from their perspective, including the knowledge that Gundren seems to have been taken to Cragmaw Castle. Almost everyone expresses incredulity about the sophistication of the goblins, and Sildar is equally baffled, though Chappy remarks on tales she has heard about a sophisticated nation of goblinfolk far to the south.</p>
        <p>Around dusk, the wagon pulls into the frontier town of Phandalin. It's a small town of log cabins and rough stone buildings, but even for its small size the town seems quite and still with a visceral sense of anticipation. Sildar refers the two groups to the Stonehill Inn near where they enter town from the north, and they stop the wagon there. Sildar heads on in, desperately needing rest and recovery. Friendly says she is going to visit her friend, the farmer Qelline Alderleaf, and see if she can lodge with Qelline and her wife. The rest enter the inn and make the acquaintance of Trilena and Toblen, the Innkeepers. Sildar and Bount take the two first-floor private rooms, and the rest of the group pays for beds in the shared upper-story loft. After a bit of grousing and retorts back and forth with Trilena, Chappy is exiled to a bed on a catwalk near the ceiling of the loft. But feelings are shortly smoothed over, and Chappy, Bounty, Nyoma, and Pandjed walk up the short flight of stairs to the common room of the Inn.</p>
        <p>Friendly leads Buddy the cow across town to the Alderleaf farm, on the southeast edge of Phandalin. Friendly knocks, and Qelline shouts hesitantly from behind the door, "Who's there?" It seems quizzical, but after the firbolg introduces herself through the wood, Qelline throws the door open and embraces Friendly. They chat warmly, catching up. Friendly asks for a favor, that she might keep Buddy in the Alderleaf's barn. "Because of all this trouble my people are having with the mining company, you see. I just want to make sure he's safe," she says. The halfling farmer readily agrees, but tells Friendly that there is at least some good news: the mining company has pulled up stakes and left town, due to the recent rumors and upset in the area. The only company representative still in town is young Halia Thornton, who used to be a low level clerk and now likes to style herself as the woman in charge. But, Qelline sadly notes, the real people in charge in the town right now are a group of young thugs known as the Redbrands. That gang is why Alderleaf was afraid to open the door, and they've been menacing the town for a while now. Friendly thanks her for the warning. Also, because Friendly mentioned her search for druidic allies as they caught up, Qelline asks Friendly for a favor in return. "I've got a friend with those sorts of talents, he ventured up to the Thundertree ruins to check things out and I haven't seen him in a while. Could you check on him? He might be a good person for you to know anyway, his name is Reidoth." Friendly agrees and wishes Qelline a good night, before heading off back to the center of town.</p>
        <p>Back at the Inn, the four wanderers have been chatting happily with Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is especially pleased to see Bounty of Nonsense again, wrapping him in a warm hug and referring to him as "m'lord." They order drinks, and after a bit of enjoyable back and forth, Bounty inquires of Toblen, "Say, friend. What is the story of that great boar head above the fireplace?" The Innkeeper launches into a tale, not about himself but of the noted Falcon the Hunter from the nearby Neverwinter Woods. Falcon is quite the game hunter, but while tracking a particular elk one morning, he discovered he was being followed by a strange looking boar. Then, a few days later, he noticed either that same boar or another like it again. And it became a pattern, him feeling watched whenever he entered the depths of the forest to pursue his quarries. So Falcon, thinking that boars are intelligent and could "get the message," set to hunt one. After days of cat and mouse he bagged his prey, and Falcon made a gift of the head to Toblen as a personal kindness. Appreciative of the story, Bount launches into one of his own in return. He tells an exaggerated version of their adventure with the weapon, and by the time he is done all of the smattering of villagers in the common room have their eyes on the tabaxi and his exotic looking comrades. When he reaches his climax there is scattered applause, and a few copper pieces wind their way to the group's table.</p>
        <p>After ordering food, the four converse amongst themselves about the recent events and their plans for the future. When Toblen brings their meals, the characters again engage him in conversation. Chappy asks the Innkeeper more about Falcon, and about the woods he inhabits, noting a certain apprehension in Toblen's tone as he told his tale earlier. Mr. Stonehill does admit some trepidation about the woods, especially as folk have been disappearing there of late. The Wood was never the friendliest place, but people speak of deeper shadows and more threatening wildlife all the time. In fact, a group of woodworkers and loggers from Phandalin, including the brother of Elmar Barthen of the general store, headed deep into the woods to create a logger's camp. The very few communications returned from them speak of rising tension between the loggers, with some believing the camp to be "cursed" or the loggers to be otherwise doomed. In response to this news, the halfling pulls out her reporter's notebook and begins quizzing Toblin on the details. "Well you know, it's important to get everything down for the Neverwinter Chronicle! … though don't necessarily expect to, uh, read about that any time soon. Mail from this far out is very unreliable, as you may have observed!" Chappy also inquires about her Uncle Al Kalazorn, who the Innkeeper is familiar with. He has not seen Al in a bit, but also thinks that Elmar of Barthen's Provisions would be likely to know more.</p>
        <p>While Chappy speaks to Toblen, Bount and Nyoma suddenly hear something odd: a birdlike caw outside that also simultaneously sounds like Bount saying his own name? Moving to investigate, they open the door to the inn and discover a crow outside – a crow cawing something remarkably similar to "Bount!" or "Friendly!" The bird is vexing, variably perching on Bount's shoulder or flying up into the rafter of the common room. Once again the group is attracting the wide-eyed attention of other patrons. Eventually an insight occurs to Nyoma and she whispers to the tabaxi, "Do you think this... could BE Friendly?" Shock is the general response, and Bounty heads with the bird outside. And indeed, the bird magically transforms back into Friendly! The tabaxi is slightly stunned, and Friendly informs him she only just learned how to do this particular trick: "It's almost as if I've reached some arbitrary plateau of power!" Bounty is distracted for a short while wondering if that's something HE could learn to do. Nyoma seems quite entertained by the entire business, as Bount tries to convince Friendly of the need for subtlety moving forward. After a while more conversation, the group retires for the night. The four head to their beds at the inn, while Friendly heads to the Alderleaf barn to sleep with Buddy.</p>
        <p>During the night, Chappy is woken by strange sounds outside the window. Peering out, up in the sky she spots an impossibly large reptilian beast, extremely pale in color and luminous in the moonlight, flapping its creaking wings as it flies in circle over the town. Absolutely stunned, the halfling falls right out of the bed. This side wakes Nyoma, and she calls up, "Chappy? Are you okay?" Chappy whispers back, "D-d-d-d-d-dragon!" Nyoma makes a delighted and fascinated noise and runs to the window, but whatever was there now seems to be gone. Still, she believes the halfing, and tells her how much she would have liked to see a dragon. Chappy does not agree, being generally shaken by the sight. The two eventually return to bed.</p>
        <p>The next morning, the individual characters split up on various errands of their own. Pandjed remains at the inn to manage his affairs. Bount heads to have his coat repaired, while Friendly spends the morning picking weeds before planning to meet up with the tabaxi. Chappy and Nyoma individually take in the town, but both end up converging on the town square around mid-morning. The halfling spots a small stone shrine to Tymora, the Goddess of Luck, currently being tended to by a dwarven woman on her hands and knees. Chappy walks up to ask her about her dwarven Uncle Al, surprising the woman in the process and causing her to quite clumsily bash her head on a shelf of the shrine. Getting up and dusting herself off, the woman introduces herself casually as Sister Graele, the keeper of the Shrine of Luck here in Phandalin. Chappy is a bit surprised at the lack of formality Graele displays. She asks the Sister about Al Kalazorn, and if she's heard anything. Graele, who seems quite absent-minded, thinks to herself and says, "You know, to think of it, I haven't seen him in quite a while. Have you ever seen a hyena? Haven't seen one myself, but Big Al says they look like what a cat would look like if it were pretending to be a dog. They roam the plains far to the east, but not around here. Anyway, Al said he saw them around his property – them, and some larger creatures in the night he could never quite identify. I do hope he's alright."</p>
        <p>Chappy frowns, and thanks Graele, and prepares to leave. But before she can, the Sister interjects, "Oy there. You seem like a capable sort." She pauses. "How do you feel about ghosts?" It's an odd and disjointed turn, and Chappy says, "Fair enough, I suppose?" Graele explains that in her personal researches, she's learned of a "ghost, or a spirit, or a banshee?" who might have some information related to the location of a very old wizard named Bowgentle, which Graele would greatly like to find. "I've got this comb and I think buttering old Agatha up would get the information out of her, but sad to say I made her quite angry last I visited." Graele asks Chappy if she would mind delivering the comb and trying to get the information out of the spirit? There is a path north from old abandoned Conyberry, a short ways into the forest and she's right there. Chappy, confused but always interested in a potential story, tentatively agrees to help and takes the comb.</p>
        <p>Bount and Friendly meet up on the southeast end of town. As they talk, suddenly Friendly spots some young toughs wearing red cloaks sauntering down the dirt road – presumably the Redbrands. They decide to sneak after them. But as the redcloaks enter the town square, they happen to turn and spot the two outsiders before they can move out of the way. The young street toughs approach Bount and Friendly, and begin trying to accost them for money. Bounty attempts to bluff his way out with his signet ring, but the thuggish redcloaks are too ignorant to even know what it is supposed to be. The redbrands wave over a larger, meaner looking friend of theirs as he enters the square, and tensions rise. Nyoma spots the growing confrontation, and with a discrete wave of her fingers creates a hand of magical energy she carefully places right behind the half cloak of the meaner looking thug. He moves toward Friendly and Bounty threateningly seeking to physically take the demanded "tax," and as he does so Nyoma's spectral hand intertwines itself with the folds of the cloak, and yanks the brute back. He stumbles back, trying to free himself from the cloak as it pulls and plays with him, and the other youths yell at him to stop playing about, referring to him as Jaren. At this confusion, Friendly steps forward and summons her mystical powers, creating a crackling green aura around the redbrands. Seeing this obvious display of magic, the gang begins shouting and cursing the characters as they fall back out of the square and begin running along the road out of town to the east. The group gives chase!</p>
        <p>While they might have expected the thugs to escape to the Sleeping Giant taproom, which they had heard was a favorite location of the Redbrands, the gang continues running out of town and up some low hills to the burned out Tresendar Manor on the very eastern edge of Phandalin. Friendly transforms once more into a bird, but this time a hawk, and scouts out the manor. Completely destroyed and only exhibiting ruined walls and still-solid foundations, Friendly the hawk spots a set of stairs leading down into the earth, presumably into a cellar. The redcloaks are nowhere to be seen. The rest of the group proceeds to the Manor. Nyoma summons her deeper perceptions, and feels the tingle of a magical source somewhere below ground. "That would be something worth protecting," she comments to the others.</p>
        <p>As a group, they investigate the stairs. Slowly descending, they find themselves in a torchlit cellar storehouse, with a large deep cistern on one end of the room. There is a door near the entrance and also one near the cistern, and they are able to spot moving shadows in the room through the door next to the cistern. Nyoma once again reaches out to feel the call of power, and is able to feel that something of vague magical energy lies beyond the wall to the left of the cistern, strangely enough. The group carefully treads to the other end of the room, and begins setting about creating a display of force, so to speak. Chappy summons up illusionary magics to create an image of two flaming fist guards standing tall on either side of Bount, who positions himself in front of the door. On a count of three, Nyoma reaches out with the tendrils of her power and slams the door to the room with a resounding crack! Bounty commands, "IN THE NAME OF THE FLAMING FIST PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!" And at the same time, Friendly collects nature's power within herself and unleashes it as a thunderous wave of pressure right into the small room. The four redcloaks are indeed there, and one is knocked off his feet into the wall behind them. The remaining thugs seem terrified at the power being unleashed on them, but Jaran screams "Fight them, boys! It's this or death!" And the gang members lunge forward at the characters. A short bloody fight ensues, in which Nyoma tries again to command the youths to lay down their weapons, but they are too caught up in the rush of battle. By the end, Jaran is unconscious and Bount is once again bleeding through his coat, but the Redbrands have been put down with no actual deaths.</p>
        <p>The party wakes one of the other three non-Jaran redcloaks, and interrogates him. Friendly intimidates him with a murderous-seeming fakeout involving death threats and a coin, but eventually the Redbrand member fesses up that this room is but the entrance to a larger secret complex underneath the manor which the Redbrands use as a hideout. He informs the characters the Redbrands are just local boys hired by a wizard named Glasstaff. The youth counts their number at around a dozen, not including the hobgoblins. "Hobgoblins?" Inquires almost everyone in the party simultaneously, to which the redcloak responds, "Oh, yeah. The spider sent them to make sure we was doing what he wants, since I guess Glasstaff works for him." The characters share a look of surprise and intrigue at this, though Chappy seems inordinately happy about "conspiracies" and "dark secrets." "Think of the story this could be!" she tells the group. The characters inquire about what this particular gang member has been up to, and he insists he has been mostly harmless, just exorting businesses for protection money. He does let slip that Jaren did kill that one wood worker, and they did end up kidnapping the woodworker's wife and daughter to be held here in the complex, but he insists that was Jaren and that everyone knows Jaren has a temper. After some haranging about morality and good decisions and making better choices by Nyoma, the group opts to let the three follower gang members leave after forcing them to promise to atone for their crimes by working for Sister Graele at the shrine. And also by leaving their coinage and valuables here to be collected by the party. The four unanimously agree to however leave Jaren tied up in the side room where the melee occurred. The follower ex-Redbrands beat it out of the cellar, but not before providing two more helpful bits of information: one, to watch out for the "eye monster," and two, that the prisoners are near the old crypt, which is full of "horrible old walking skeletons, like something out of a nightmare."</p>
        <p>Exploring the wall to the left of the cistern, the party is able to discover a secret door leading to a long hallway passing off into unknown regions. Friendly transforms into a rat, and begins stalking forward down the twisting hall. The hall eventually opens up into a long, tall natural cavern with a chasm running longwise through it. As Friendly the rat studies the scene before her, an intrusive thought in her head suddenly adopts words as a rasping sentence is forced into her consciousness: "Well, hello there interesting little creature. You are much too big for the tiny body you currently inhabit."</p>

        <p>Confronted with the eerie rasping thought-sounds invading her inner mental narrative, Friendly responds with bald-faced lies. She insists to the voice that she IS a rat, and that the voice must be sorely mistaken. After a few moments of this back and forth, the voice goes silent. Friendly moves back to the rest of the group in the room with the cistern. Friendly the rat squeaks excitedly, prompting Bount to lean in and ask, "Friendly, could that – be you?" Chappy erupts in sudden annoyance, "It's obviously her! Do we have to do this every time? Can we please be getting on with this?" Not able to understand any of what Friendly tries to communicate about the room or the voice, the party prepares to move forward into the room with the narrow chasm. As they slowly creepy away from the finished stone toward winding natural rock walls and into the dark cavern, the rest of the group new begins to experience the unnerving static-y sensation at the back of their heads and necks that Friendly previously experienced. It is worst for Nyoma, who finds herself the next target of the voice. Audible only to her inside her head, it demands to know who they are and what they intend to do in this place. "Guys!" She yells out, "I think someone here has a message spell? I've never experienced it before but I read about it once and this seems just like it! Are you using a message spell?" She similarly stonewalls the voice, and eventually it says one final word before going completely silent: "<b><i>Disrespectful.</i></b>" After a few minutes, the unpleasant mental buzzing also stops affecting the four adventurers.</p>
        <p>Gazing about the room, they see a long narrow room split by a chasm, with two narrow raw plank bridges spanning the pit. Two passages lead off to the west, into more finished stone walls and flagstone floors. A single winding natural stone passage twists off to the south. And the cavern seems to transition into a finished room of sorts off to the north, outside of the range of Nyoma's spell of light, centered on Chappy's pointed hat (due to the halfing not possessing the ability to see in dim or dark areas). They cross the southern bridge, which is no problem for Friendly the rat but collapses almost immediately under Nyoma's weight. She falls almost twenty feet and lands, bruised and slightly battered, but is able to climb back up the chasm with only minor difficulty and the assistance of a vine whip produced magically by Friendly, no longer shifted into the form of a rat. The group explores the southern tunnel, only to realize it extends for a long distance. Chappy muses, "Wasn't there supposed to be a tavern they lurk around? Maybe this tunnel leads there?" The group follows the tunnel a short distance, but returns on realizing it extends quite a long way. After some discussion, they decide to head down the more southern of the two western exists.</p>
        <p>"Well, I have been requested to attempt to be more brave," says Bount, pulling himself up to his full tall height. "So I will, ah, do my best here." He gingerly pads forward quietly through the passage, once again encountering finished floors and walls and a staircase leading briefly down. On the lower level, the passage turns sharply to the right and there is a door on the left. Unlike the dark chasm room, this passage is lit by lanterns. The tabaxi pauses just before the turning of the passage, and cocks his hears to try and gauge far-off sounds. Off to the left, through the door, he hears a distant sound of something striking something else, like a stick against a bag of potatoes. Creeping back to the group, he tells them what he heard. "Maybe this way whoever is in there is distracted, and we can keep going?" Chappy retorts, "Come on! What if someone is in danger in there and needs our help?" Friendly: "Yeah, buddy, sounds like somebody is in danger. We can just ignore that." After some back and forth, Bount is convinced. They formulate a plan, and take up position inside the cavern just outside the passage, ready to take action.</p>
        <p>Nyoma summons up the power granted to her by Selune, and the ground in the passage – and in the rooms beyond – begins to shake and tremor as if in an earthquake! From the room there is the sound of shouting, and the door opens. A red-skinned hobgoblin in military-style chain mail emerges, wearing the livery of the Cragmaws, distracted and discombobulated by the shaking earth. Coming out the passage, he sees the adventurers, and is stopped for a moment in confusion. Bounty of Nonsense yells down the passage, "Hail there! We were sent here by Clash!" And suddenly the hobgoblin's look of confusion is replaced by one of cold fury, and he turns to the other occupants of the room: "Beware, comrades! The outsiders have come to rescue the traitor goblin!"</p>
        <p>What follows is a protracted, bloody battle. The room proves to contain two mailed male hobgoblin soldiers bearing deadly sharp longswords, and a tall thin female hobgoblin in night-black leathers and wearing a lurid-red carved demon mask covering her entire face except for her mouth. The hobgoblins pour out of the room, taking cover behind the doorframe and the corner as the party takes cover around the exit of the passage. They trade ranged fire before the fight becomes a chaotic melee in the room with the chasm. The masked hobgoblin turns out to be lethally quick and strong with fists and punches threatening to break the party's bones. It is a frightening and difficult struggle, as the hobgoblins seem to have been militarily trained and pose the first real threat the adventurers have yet faced. But the party gives as good as it gets, trading blow for blow.</p>
        <p>Throughout all this, Bount seems hesitant to commit to the violence and the bloodshed. As the battle continues and his comrades begin to seem exhausted and increasingly wounded, he is struck by a sudden idea. He steals away down the passage and into the left-most room, to see what was being hidden here. And in that room he discovers Clash, bound in a cage hung from the ceiling by a short metal chain. "Why am I not surprised to see you again?" She asks, with resignation in her voice. The tabaxi thinks quickly and makes her an offer: "If I let you go, will you help us?" After a moment's thought, the goblin responds, "I don't think I have much of a choice." And after a quick application of lockpicking tools and expertise to the padlock holding the cage shut, Clash is free and on the ground. "Here," Bount tells her as he hands her his dagger. She rushes out of the room, deadly serious about her task. Emerging from the passage just behind one of the hobgoblin soldiers, she efficiently sticks the dagger in his back between his ribs. "That's what you get, you bastard."</p>
        <p>With this turn of the tide, the fight begins to turn toward the adventurer's favor. But only then, something horrible happens. Suddenly, the eerie tingling back of the head feeling returns for everyone. And loping up out of the bottom of the chasm is an awful creature, hunched over and alternately walking bipedally and loping along on both hands and feet. Its body is elongated with wet moldy-red seeming skin, and most of its face is a single monstrously distended eye. In everyone's thoughts a sudden rasp intrudes: "<b><i>Disrespectful creatures are made into meat.</i></b>" This terrible thing corners Chappy against a wall, slicing at her with its claws and fixing it with baleful necromantic magics with bonechilling stares from its great piercing eye. Though by this point one of the hobgoblins has fallen, the masked "monk" has proved a more than suitable challenge. And she maneuvers herself behind the creature for cover, using her position to more easily strike at Chappy. But surprisingly, the monster does not take well to this, and snaps out at the masked hobgoblin in addition to the adventurers! The party makes the most of this and presses their advantage on the hobgoblin, eventually forcing her to retreat across the chasm and away. They let her go, being forced to simultaneously deal with the creature. After some time, its voiceless message erupts into Chappy's mind, "<b><i>Submit to me.</i></b>" Chappy surrenders, and the rest of the group follows shortly after. With the creature staring grimly at them, most of the party retreats to the room where Chappy was kept prisoner, with Bount leading the way. Friendly remains behind, intent on negotiating terms. "So, what do you want, eh?" "<b><i>I must feed on magic. This body... I was... no matter. Any magic you find here, you must feed to me.</i></b>" Friendly attempts to argue the monster down, but it budges not even a little. Finally, she agrees to its terms, tossing it a Shillelagh-enchancted piece of wood before following her companions in retreat.</p>
        <p>With the entire group – plus Clash the goblin – secuestered away in the room with the door shut, everyone takes a moment to breath. But it's not long before someone asks, "What in the world WAS that thing?" Nyoma looks pensive for a moment before responding, "I think it's called a Nothic. I don't know a lot about them, but I do know they feed on magical energies. Also, at least some of them started as people but were cursed to become like that? But I'm not sure if all of them are that way." Friendly then explains the terms of the deal she made with the Nothic. No one is entirely happy about it, but they are all happy to be away from the thing. Finally, Friendly turns toward Clash. "So, what do we do about her?"</p>
        <p>Clash sits on one of the beds in the small room, fixedly staring at the floor. "Don't you think you've already done enough?" Bount tries to clam her down, "Now, now. What do you mean? Don't you see what we've done for you here? We've freed you, that's a good thing." "Are you kidding me?" Clash seems unconvinced. " You don’t actually have any idea what you've done, do you? You've ruined my life." Bount responds, "Better that then them killing you! Why are you here, anyway?" "Because of you! You still got those traveling papers you forced me at swordpoint to write?" Friendly grins and proudly holds them up: "Right here!" Clash: "That's why, right there. You're the ones who killed me! Maybe they would have tortured me for a while, but there was at least a chance they would have let me go! Now if they ever see me again, they're definitely kill me. If I ever return to my homeland, they'll definitely kill me. You're just as bad as the hobgoblins," she moans wretchedly. Friendly is entirely unsympathetic to this, "Mmm. Well, if you're going to say we're just as bad as them, maybe we should be. Maybe we should just kill you." Finally, Chappy steps in and interjects, "Friendly, Bount, be quiet. Clash? You're right. We did play a role in how you got here, and I know that now because of what we did it looks to them that you're working with us. I'm sorry for that. It's awful to have something taken from you, some of us at least do know that. But maybe we can help. My uncle has a farm, or I'm sure there are goblins in Waterdeep..." Friendly continues to argue and antagonize Clash, fully convinced she is a menace who would be better off dead. At one point Clash gets in Friendly's face, yelling and inviting the firbolg to end her life. But Chappy, Nyoma, and Bount defuse the situation. Eventually Bount negotiates a truce whereby Clash agrees to give them information, and in exchange, the party will try to fund her escape somewhere where she could be safe. At length, Clash reluctantly agrees.</p>
        <p>As the group rests, Clash tells them what she knows of where they are. The individuals torturing her were part of the Iron Shadows, a special force within the Cragmaw Auxiliary responsible for rooting out treachery and engaging in spying. They were interrogating Clash on suspicion that she collaborated with the adventurers. Clash estimates that in this Redbrand hideout there were maybe a dozen redcloaks in addition to their leader, the wizard Glasstaff. But, she also comments quizzically, there is no way the battle earlier wouldn't have roused every single other person in the hideout with the shouts and the noise of the clash. Clash insists on waiting until they reach a more safe locale before providing any further information. "After all, I'm not really convinced yet you're not just going to kill me."</p>
        <p>After resting, the party sets off down the passage toward a second door just around the corner. Inside they find a sort of common room, filled with tapped kegs and a table with what looks to have been an interrupted dice game in progress with drinks, half-eaten food, and coin still on the table. Chairs in the room are strewn about as if the players left in a hurry. Friendly collects the coins from the table and distributes them around. Bount takes his share, places them in a small pack, and subtly tosses it over to Clash. She looks up at him and brusquely responds, "Don't think I'm happy about this," but she takes the coins nonetheless.</p>
        <p>The group continues to explore out of the common room toward the north, passing through a hallway on their way to a second door. Inside the door they find a well-stocked alchemical laboratory and library. Nyoma practically vibrates with delight at the collection of books, scrolls, documents, and knowledge available. Studying the alembics and vials and other distallation equipment on the table she announces, "Looks like someone was trying to brew a potion of invisibility. No success yet, though, I think." The group then waits while she examines the books in the library. Most are tomes about alchemy and regional history, no different than anything she has seen before. But in particular, she comes across a book reprinting the journal of a dwarven roustabout named Urmon chronicling the history of the area around Phandalin. She eagerly dives in.</p>
        <p>According to Urmon, more than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great mystical energy. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a device called the Forge of Spells, which it was said "granted to its master a great and terrible power of magical creation." Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin prospered as well. But then disaster struck when the mine was attacked by individuals eager to seize the power of the Forge. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost. Also lost along with the cave was the fabled weapon Lightbringer, and enchanted hammer created to protect the Forge from malefactors.</p>
        <p>Digesting and summarizing all of this information for the rest of the group, Nyoma eagerly admits, "I have to tell you all something. This is why I'm here. This Forge, it's why I came to this area. Its effects have been felt from far away, and I've journeyed here to find this phenomenal artifact. I never expected to find anything about it down here, but well..." Chappy responds with similar excitement, "Wow! That sounds amazing. That could be like, not just an article but a whole book! Would you possibly be willing to sign a contract of exclusivity here? I mean, we can talk about that later, but it sounds fascinating in any case." "Indeed," echoes Bount, "but we should probably finish exploring here." The group moves beyond another door to another room to the east of the lab, after spending a moment to try and ensure they hear no noises beyond the door.</p>
        <p>The room they enter seems to be some kind of bedroom, with plush red drapes covering the walls. A comfortable bed sits in the room with a closed chest at its foot, and there is a nicely-detailed writing desk covered in paper and ink. And at one spot in the wall, the drapes are shifted aside to reveal a portion of the wall having been left ajar. A secret door! But before proceeding, Nyoma and Bount open the chest and look inside. They find exquisite women's clothing, suitable for traveling, several piles of coins and gems, a scroll case containing a magical scroll, and a strange-looking round featureless wooden mask, also clearly (to the tiefling) mystically enchanted. Nyoma also examines the writing desk. There she finds two items of importance – a letter to a "Lord Albrek" from an individual signing the letter with the sigil of a spider, and a small shiny black stone pyramid inscribed with an odd incoherent mix of celestial and infernal sigils. The party discusses the contents of the letter and the small object, which Nyoma assumes must be the key discussed.</p>
        <img src="./images/session_3_letter.png" className="session-img img-shadow" alt="Session 3 Letter" />
        <p>They then move on, exploring the rest of the hideout complex. In one of the last areas to be explored, they find the family crypt of the Tresendar Manor, with sarcophagi complete with images of the occupants from life carved into the lids. Already plundered is the crypt of Aldith Tresendar, patron of the family and they presume the source from which the key was found. Everyone except Bount wants to investigate the other crypts for valuables or other import items. "Hold on, hold on everyone," Bount says, pausing the activity. "I know we've been forced to do some difficult things today, but disturbing the rest of this family? This woman and her two daughters? Doesn't that seem cruel and cold?" He does his best to convince them not to exume these tombs, but in the end the best he can do is to get them to agree to look and only take objects if they are strictly relevant to what seems to be going on. The tabaxi excuses himself while the others look, finding nothing.</p>
        <p>Proceeding onward, the group happens on one last noteworthy encounter: the remaining members of the Dendrar family, locked in cells just off the crypt! There is a moment of confusion due to Bount wearing a Redbrand cloak, but it is cleared up when they explain they are here to save the Dendrars. The mother and two Dendrar children thank them profusely, and after a moment raiding the discovered armory of the redcloaks, the adventurers lead the Dendrars out of the hideout (making sure to stay far away from the room with the chasm and the creature they have taken to calling Timothy) back toward town to safety. Before the Dendrars leave the group, the mother Mirna informs them, "I don't have any valuables to pay you with. But my family lived in Thundertree when I was a girl, before the walking dead claimed the town. My mother owned an herb and alchemy shop, and kept an emerald necklace in a case under the storage shelves. If you're ever down that way and locate the necklace, please keep it with my thanks." The Dendrars then make their own way back into town. The group stops for a moment and debates where to take Clash, eventually deciding on Bount's private room at the Inn. Bount brings out his disguise kit to do his best to make it slightly less obvious that Clash is a goblin, and the now five individuals reenter Phandalin, doing their best not to draw attention in the growing evening.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The five – Nyoma Izarren, Chappy Quickstep, Bounty of Nonsense, Friendly, and the goblin clash – stand on a hillside on the edge of town as the sun sets. Having just let the Redcloak's hideout under Tresendar Manor, their aim is to move Clash to Bount's private room at the Stonehill Inn without the goblin being seen by any townsfolk. The group huddles together, and the hatch a plan which they quickly put into action. Leaning down, Bount pulls out his disguise kit and calls Clash over. He does his best to make over the goblin to resemble a human, though the end effect is one that is undoubtedly better when viewed at a distance. "Hey Chappy," Bount calls over to the halfing, "can I borrow your hooded robe very briefly?" After adjusting the hood around Clash's face, he announces "Ok, there you go. But, um, maybe try and mostly look down as we head into down?" Clash grins mirthlessly and groans, "Sure. Whatever you need."  </p>
        <p>Entering the village, Nyoma reaches out her hand with fingers outstretched, closing her fist as the lights on the path to the Inn dim, reducing visibility. Bount tries to stealthily cover Clash on the narrow dirt paths as they sneak along. But they are accosted by a merchant: "Ho there, traveler! Might you be interested in purchasing some garlic? I've got all kinds, including some for medicinal purposes. Forgive me for saying, but your child looks a bit ill!" This is where Nyoma intercedes, showing an extreme amount of interest in the merchant's wares and everything they might be able to be used for. "Would you possibly have any black garlic? I love it, it's such a delicacy!" And as the merchant digs around in his pouch to produce some for the tiefling, Clash and Bount are able to sidle on around and ahead.  </p>
        <p>Finally, they just have to get around the village square to reach the Inn. "I've got an idea," Chappy informs the others, and she jogs ahead to the middle of the square. Grabbing her lute, she proceeds to begin loudly playing a ballad titled "The Green Halfling." In it, she sings about the rainbow of colors that a halfling can be born with, and that before one judges too quickly, maybe you should think twice or even thrice. The initial crowd response trends negative, but the bard manages to feel the air of the crowd and using her halfling ingenuity, lands a couple of jokes in time with comments from the crowd and manages to win them over. As the crowd gathers, Bount and Nyoma are able to escort Clash through a back door into the Inn without further attention. Seeing them go, Chappy abruptly announces the end of her show and leaves the crowd most definitely wanting more.  </p>
        <p>With the entire party stuffed inside Bounty of Nonsense's private room, everyone has a chance to relax and breath for the first time in a while. Nyoma steps out to speak with Toblen Stonehill to order dinner for the group, and when she returns she says, "So, what now? What is our plan here?"</p>
        <p>The group first considers what to do to help Clash. Chappy suggests they find her uncle, Big Al Kalazorn, and that he could offer Clash employment as a shipment guard and a route to Neverwinter. Bount lets Clash know they want to do what they can to help her. Clash for her part apologizes for her bitterness and lets the group know that she sees that everything they've done they have done for good reasons, and that she appreciates the efforts they are going to in order to help her now. Bout in turn asks Clash want she wants. Clash admits that she liked her previous life, that she put on a uniform to help people and because following orders comes easy to her. But she signed up to help people in her country, her empire, not to travel a thousand miles and muck about in the lives of people far away. She says she realizes now the Cragmaw aren't as justified or righteous as she once thought. And she would like to find a way to make her own decisions. The group agrees to help her do that. Chappy initially posits a plan where they leave first thing tomorrow, before the sun rises, but Clash asks them to hold off because the Cragmaw or the Black Spider may be looking for her. They agree to lay low for a while.</p>
        <p>Next, the conversation turns to the Forge of Spells. Nyoma speaks passionately about the need to investigate it and ensure it is taken care of. Bount seems worried about what the Forge could be and about the consequences of this plan, and Clash agrees, noting that often things that are so important are also very dangerous. It takes a fair bit of convincing for Nyoma and also Chappy to convince Bount they have something approaching an obligation to see that the Forge does not fall into the wrong hands. </p>
        <p>As one final note before the group breaks up, Bount looks over at Chappy and says, "Hey, would you have any idea where I could get a document or something with Townmaster Wester's signature on it?" The halfling fixes Bount with a look of extreme skepticism, and narrowing her eyes she says, "What are you up to here?" "Oh, nothing, nothing at all! You know me!" Responds Bounty, quickly changing the subject. </p>
        <p>Bount and Clash remain in the room, planning to bed down for the night. Both Nyoma and Chappy excuse themselves. Nyoma leaves the inn, but Chappy moves to the Inn's common room. It is loud and boisterous tonight, with a colorful crowd (literally) shouting over cards. She gets a drink and pulls out a magical tome she had left over from Bard College. She begins studying a spell for the rapid heating of metal, reading it over and over until she feels the mental exhaustion coming over her. Finishing a second ale and reading a single paragraph for the tenth time in the loud common room, she thinks to herself, "Wow! This really is just like the College." She then puts up the spellbook and ambles over to the card table. </p>
        <p>While Chappy is studying, Nyoma has found herself a quiet open place in the field behind the Inn. Locating a small tumbled Wall, the tiefling settles down beside it and takes up a meditative position. She reflects on the events of the past few days, internally narrating her journey and the people and things she has encountered. She is delivering this story to Selune, reporting on her progress and the things that she has seen to her patron goddess. Perhaps Nyoma considers how different her life has been since leaving Candlekeep, how she never quite imagined the outside world would be like this. Throughout all of this, though, she acquires a feeling of peace and tranquility. She looks forward to the full moon two more nights hence, when Selune's power in the world will wax. But as she is winding down her meditation and preparing to leave, Nyoma is suddenly startled out of her reverie by a sudden chill wind creaking out of the east. She finds herself covered in a strangely localized dusting of snow, carried by the wind but seemingly existing nowhere else. This is highly unusual, given the early fall (or even late summer) time of the year currently.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Chappy is playing cards with a group consisting of an exceptionally tall wood elf with a drawling accent who has introduced himself as Gazzenar or simply Gazz, and his identical twin water genasi companions Pax and Drax. As they play Three Dragon Ante and Chappy slowly accrues sizable winning, Gazz reveals that he has heard of the halfling bard and her companions. "There was something about a pet raven? Or crow? Some kind of bird, surely. You must be adventures, do tell me your tales!" But Chappy feels there is something not quite right about this group, and both hems and haws when it comes to herself and plays up her own drunkenness. The wood elf continues to go on, explaining that he and his companions are also adventurers, and have found themselves in the perhaps unenviable position of being dragon hunters of late. Before Chappy excuses herself from the table with a tidy sum in hand, Gazzenar makes sure to inform her: "Now mind, if you do happen to come upon the location of any dragon dens or nests or other locations of habitation, we would pay good coin for such information. Do let us know!" </p>
        <p>The next morning, the party (minus Friendly and Pandjed) are enjoying a breakfast of herring and ham in Bount's room with Clash. After Nyoma brings the food, Chappy insists on paying and mentions her surprise windfall at the table last night. "Also, the money was won from some people who were suspicious as hell." Bount: "Don't you think you're burying the lede there? What people?" Chappy explains, including about them being dragon hunters. Much like with the Forge of Spells, Bount seems shocked and incredulous at the idea of there actually being any dragons about. "Well, uh, I actually saw one," Chappy admits. "Isn't it EXCITING?" Nyoma exclaims. Bount once again stops the conversation: "Talk about burying the lede twice in a row, Chappy! When in the world did you see a dragon?" The halfling finally explains what she saw and shared with Nyoma the night it happened. While Nyoma continues to seem fascinated by the possibility of dragons, Bount and Chappy are noticably less enthused. Together they agree to be less "dragon hunters," and more "dragon watchers," or even more passively, "dragon noticers."</p>
        <p>The three head out for the day, leaving Clash behind to hide out in the room. They together head to the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company able to supply them with traveling gear and personal arms for Clash and for themselves. After that, they had to drop in on Sildar. He continues to be recuperating in bed, covered with bandages and with a split pinning one of his arms. Hallwinter is quite pleased to see them, warmly greeting them and imploring Bount if he has any additional information on Gundren or his location. But first Nyoma on seeing Sildar's condition, reaches out and uses her power to speed his healing along. The human mercenary is vocally grateful for the tiefling's ministrations. To Hallwinter's initial question, Bount replies that they do, but that while they are going to get the dwarf – that they are definitely on a path that so to speak eventually leads to the dwarf – there is someone else they must help first. Sildar seems concerned about this, but the group assuages him that this other person also dearly needs help and that they will rescue Rockseeker. "But can I ask," Bount inquires, "How is Gundren's mettle? Will he last?" Sildar assures them that the dwarf is as tough as brass tacks and that he will last come hell or high water. They then speak for a while, with Hallwinter giving his opinion on the best methods for overcoming Cragmaw Castle and rescuing the dwarf, finishing up with, "and frankly, the easiest route might be if you could get someone on the inside, who could help you bypass the security." For just a moment the tabaxi gets a glint of inspiration in his eye before Chappy cuts him off with a highly icy, "No, Bount. Whatever you're thinking, don't." Eventually the group bid their farewells to Sildar and begin leaving. But before they can get out the door, the mercenary forces a pouch of gold coins into their hands as thanks for saving his life. He then thanks them and wishes them well in their upcoming journey.  </p>
        <p>Toward dinner time, the group once again waits for a meal to be brought to them in Bounty's room. They discuss the possibility of having Chappy once more act as a patsy at the card table to learn more about the suspicious dragon hunters, when someone knocks on the door. Outside is Trilena Stonehill, with a tray of meals in hand. But before she hands them over, she hesitantly informs the group, "Um, I'm sorry for the bother. But there is some kind of important looking woman out in the village square. She has asked for everyone to head out there for some kind of announcement 'of grave importance?'" Looks of concern and dread cross the faces of all those in the room.</p>
        <p>Nyoma, Chappy, and Bount head outside to the square, making sure to stay to the edges of the crowd. In the middle, elevated on a hastily placed wooden crate, is a prim and proper woman with long blonde hair pulled back, wearing exquisitely-trimmed red robes. Nyoma gasps and points at the woman's hand: "A glass staff!" And indeed, it is a long staff topped by a vaguely luminiescent glass sphere. The woman occasionally leans down and speaks to some tough-looking local youths, types who are not currently wearing red cloaks but one might not be surprised if they had been a day or two ago.  </p>
        <p>She begins speaking: "Good towns folk, some of you may know me and others may not. My name is Iarno Albrek, and I am a wizard and a member of the Lord's Alliance, representing the major powers of the Sword Coast. I have unfortunate and frightening news to bring to you tonight. There are goblins in our midst!" The crowd erupts in murmers and isolated shouts of fear and anger. "They are hiding somewhere in this town, laying the groundwork for their comrades to invade this village and lay waste to everything you have created." The volume increases as the tension in the crowd ratchets up. "But we will not let them do this! We are going to be organizing search parties. We will search house by house, until these horrible monsters are uncovered and we can secure our safety once more!" At this point a true panic has set in, and at that moment the three take the opportunity to scurry away back to Bount's room in the Inn.</p>
        <p>Speaking in hushed tones even in the privacy of the room, the three express confusion and fear over what is happening. Shortly, Pandjet and Friendly join them. "Iarno Albrek... that's Glasstaff. That's the leader of the Redbrands. She's working for the Black Spider," muses Nyoma, connecting the dots. "She was the woman the letter from the Spider was addressed to, and she also had the Forge key." Chappy says, "And now she's coming for us." Plans are hurriedly made, until they can hear a commotion outside the door down the hall. It sounds like Trilena, stridenly yelling, "I'm not sure if I can allow you to search the rooms of my guests!" Bount stands up: "It's time to go."</p>
        <p>The three, along with Clash, sneak out of the Inn room window onto the grassy field outside the inn. Search parties with lanterns led by young toughs are walking up and down the paths on the other sides of the building. "Hold on," Nyoma instructs the others. She sneaks off to the stable on the north side of the inn, and as quietly as possible she begins freeing the horses and preparing them to travel. But just as she is leading them out, one is spooked and whinnies. Outside Nyoma hears a voice, "Hey! I just heard something inside the stable! Let's go!"  </p>
        <p>Running now, the tiefling leads the horses outside and begins organizing her companions onto the horses. "Clash, you should be with me on my horse. Bount, Pandjed, and Chappy, I think you're going to have to share one too unfortunately." Bount responds, "Don't worry about me, I can handle myself here." Nyoma rejoins with, "You're going to keep up with horses? Are you serious? We have to leave!" But Bounty calmly assures her he's got this. And off they go.  </p>
        <p>The party engages in a cat and mouse game (albeit one with the cat in the role of the mouse), dodging torch-bearing search parties between houses. The tabaxi proves more than capable of keeping up with the horses in the dark and treacherous night ride, variably running on two legs and occasionally dropping to sprint on all fours. Eventually they are noticed the groups led by the youths as well as Albrek begin to follow, but by this time the group is in a field leading to a northeastern gap and on into the wilds around Phandalin. Fleeing on the horses, Nyoma is in the lead. She and Clash leap over a short rock wall, and are suddenly surprised by an outlying search party of villagers absent any of the young toughs leading the more aggressive groups. The villagers, spotting a hastily made up Clash and Nyoma, suddenly pause. They were ready to search, but upon being surprised by a pair on horseback in the dark, they are not so sure of what to do on reaching the finding part of the exercise. Thinking fast and making the most of the hesitation, Nyoma spurs her horse onward and they thunder off down a hill and away from the village toward escape, with the rest of the party not far behind. </p>

        <p>Nyoma, Bount, Chappy, and Clash sit under the stars in a clearing several miles out of Phandalin. It is the middle of the night, and they just evaded the search parties hunting for the goblin. They plot where to head next, eventually deciding to indeed try for Uncle Big Al Kalazorn's farmstead as a possible route to safety for Clash. "Though I should say, Uncle Al's maybe... not the biggest fan of goblins? You know how dwarves are," she says, looking hesitant. Clash looks slightly alarmed, prompting Bount to reply, "Hey, you know, people can change. Look at... well, probably all of us." Bedding down for the night, it is chilly and the party is left without much warm traveling gear. There is some back-and-forth between Chappy and Bount, with Chappy remarking about how nice it must be to have a fur coat, prompting Bount to retort, "Just don't skin the tabaxi, okay?" Chappy is of course horrified at this suggestion.</p>
        <p>During the night's watch, Nyoma once again settles into meditation and communing with Selune. She reports on everything she has seen and experienced so far, with her search for Iarno Albrek and having learned Albrek is apparently in the service of the Black Spider. The meditation causes an unexpected feeling of warmth to suffuse throughout her being, and she is at peace while communing. It is but one more night until the full moon, when Selune's power in the world is maximized. The tiefling feels electric at the prospect.</p>
        <p>The group spends the next day traveling over fields parallel to the road, heading to the west toward Conyberry and Big Al's land. During the day, they encounter a worn ancient-seeming stone marker. Probably used in the past to indicate directions and place names, the glyphs carved into the stone are far too worn to be read. But they seem to refer to the east-west Triboar trail the group currently parallels, as well as a beaten-down ghostly remnant of a path heading south up into the foothills of the Sword mountains. The rest of the day is uneventful. </p>
        <p>It is the night watch, there in the remote fields and copses of trees, where the day's main events occur. Chappy taking first watch, continually has the eerie feeling of being watched. After the turns the watch over to Nyoma, the tiefling devotee of Selune prepares for an involved personal ritual, to commune even more closely with her diety. As she engages in the internal rhythms and motions, reflecting on her experiences so far, she is startled awake to realize the moon hangs low in the sky. Not just hanging low in the sky, see sees the moon descend bodily further and further, until its shining bright immensity almost fills the edges of her vision. The white-yellow full moon hangs so close to the earth she could almost touch it. As she studies this, Nyoma is alarmed to realize the edges of the moon are slowly being swallowed by shadow. The darkness swallows more and more of the moon, until only a pinprick is left shining through. "Please, please, I don't... understand. I don't know what this means," Nyoma pleads internally with the opaque rules governing this vision. And with this pleading, the tiefling hears a simple phrase intoned in her ears: "Hunger seeks power, regardless of intent." At this, the pinprick of light explodes outwards, blinding her momentarily. When she recovers, the moon is once more high in the sky where it should be, and the vision is over. But at her feet is a tome, a Book of Shadows containing new powers and secrets of her celestial patron.</p>
        <p>Nyoma does not mention any of this to Bount as he takes the third watch, but the tabaxi has an unnerving experience of his own. After two or three hours, just as things are becoming perfectly monotonous, Bounty of Nonsense hears a strange, eerie cry from in the wood surrounding their camp. It is halfway between an animal yowl and a vaguely humanoid-sounding cry: "Help!" Bount cries out in response, "Hello?" The voice or noise or whatever it might be sounds again, slightly closer. Once again, but more anxiously this time from Bount: "Hello? Is anyone there and do you need help?" One more time, the voice-noise. Bount now debates with himself, to charge off and be brave or to be cautious and hold off. In the end, the tabaxi leans toward caution and also skepticism, and remains in camp. The voice-noise is not heard again. </p>
        <p>In the morning, over breakfast the group discusses all that happened during the night with concern and trepidation. Bount is alarmed by Nyoma's vision, while the tiefling is chiefly excited in response, but also curious about the meaning of the curious sight and the whispered phrase. Nyoma also explains some of the tantalizing new rituals and spells contained in the tome granted her by Selune. One spell in particular includes the ability to identify a magical item. Excitedly trying this on the mask the group found in Iarno Albrek's things, she is finally able to put a name to the object: The Mask Within. The Mask allows the user to detect the thoughts of others, or to detect their presence from thoughts if unseen. Due to her particular history, the use of this magical artifact disquiets Nyoma significant, and neither of her companions seem exactly comfortable with it either. Eventually Nyoma grudgingly agrees to take it, not entirely sure how she feels about that. The warlock also takes a break from the rest of the group for a while shortly after this. She returns to everyone holding an owl, who she explains is her new companion and whose name is... Kevin.</p>
        <p>After breakfast, the party decamps and begin's the day's hike. Yet a very curious thing occurs: the day – or at least the sun – never actually quite comes. As time proceeds, the group realizes it never gets any lighter than twlight, and thick clouds cover the entire sky. It produces an ominous atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Toward mid-afternoon, the party approaches the outskirts of the abandoned town of Conyberry. They converse for a moment about how none of them know exactly why or when Conyberry was abandoned, simply that it's known as a local landmark for being abandoned. They decide to proceed down the Triboar trail through the middle of the ruined settlement. But on entering the outskirts, they realize the abandoned town is not at all ordinary. The road, buildings, and even the earth as they proceed have all been turned into some kind of strange glass-like substance. Nyoma examines the glass and declares this was the product of magic, but of what kind of magic she is unsure. In spots the glass substance has been stained with mysterious oily black viscous material.</p>
        <p>Continuing on, the group crosses a stream, and climbing up the other bank they are suddenly set upon by loping, leering, cackling hyena creatures! Gnolls, Nyoma identifies them, hunched over vaguely humanoid parodies of hyenas with exposed brain matter and muscle tissue, drooling the oily viscous black sludge spotted earlier. The foursome leaps into combat, as more and more waves of the demonic hyena creatures fall upon them. After a tense pitched battle they overwhelm their foes, and opt to retreat across the stream and circle around Conyberry before possibly more of those creatures can appear.</p>
        <p>They find no more monstrous creaturesm passing north of Conyberry and into the edges of the massive and foreboding Neverwinter Wood. They do cross a trail heading from Conyberry further north into the Wood. Chappy looks north along the trail and muses, "I wonder if this leads to Agatha's cottage." After a moment of reflection, the group continues on.</p>
        <p>The twilight descends into night, and the party hikes on, close to Big Al's. After two hours of full darkness, they approach the cornfields surrounding the farmstead. Passing across an open pasture to the east of the farmhouse, they are startled to realize a hastily constructed barrier wall spans the grounds immediately surrounding the farmhouse. Investigating, they make contact with Alphone Kalazorn himself on the other side of the wall peering down at them: "Little niece, is what you? What in the world are you doing out here, in all this horrible mess?" He helps them up and over, and he embraces Chappy warmly but it is obvious he is haggard and worn down. One of his farmhands, a woman named Nessil, looks over the wall at the two horses the group left behind. She darkly comments, "You know, it's been a while since our meat ran out..." But she trails off and leaves before anyone can follow up. With no further explanation, Big Al leads them up to the farmhouse. </p>
        <p>In the two-story farmhouse, the group discovers over half a dozen families cramped inside, and all eyes are on them as they enter. Big Al leads them to the kitchen where they catch up briefly. Chappy introduces her friends and explains she has come to help, not having heard from Uncle Al in ages. Big Al realizes Chappy is falling into the familiar life of an adventurer, and his eyes swell with pride. With time and some reluctance, Alphonse explains what happened here. They first spotted the hyena creatures several months ago, but over the weeks they got more violent and more destructive and more numerous. Several weeks ago they began attacking other farmsteads in this rural sparsely populated region, and Alphonse having been an adventurer, began gathering families for common defense at his farmstead. Maybe ten days ago, the day stopped coming, and during the darkest night the gnolls now test the walls. "I'm worried about our ability to hold out, with our supplies so low. We might have been better off if that wizard and his furtive-seeming companion at Old Owl Well had accepted my request for them to join us and provide assistance, but seemingly their obscure arcane researches kept them too busy. I hope they are still alive, at least." Their conversation is briefly interrupted by an old busybody local, deeply suspicious of the newcomers and concerned for the remaining supplies at an almost paranoid level. Bount is able to quell her by flagrantly displaying his signet ring. They are granted peace for the moment as she retreats back upstairs, though Big Al intimates that she is not without her followers here, unfortunately.</p>
        <p>Overnight, the group volunteers to help the locals patrol the walls. It turns out to be an extremely jarring experience, as the creatures outside scratch and bang at the walls intermittently, seemingly randomly producing bangs at locations both close and far from each other.</p>
        <p>Chappy takes first watch. After she is out there a while, Big Al comes to speak with her. He seems very concerned about her and the dangerous path she is setting down, but Chappy assures him she will be fine. Big Al informs the halfing something she was not aware of, that her Aunt Lisa was very taken with her, and paid significant attention to stories about Chappy from Chappy's mom. "She saw something of herself in you, something about your not quite fitting in but driving to find a place for yourself." Chappy is surprised but gratified. At length and with some awkwardness, Uncle Al tells Chappy she should speak more with Sister Graele back at Phandalin. "She was a close friend and companion of your Aunt, and she knows this life. If you're going to do this, you need support. Maybe just think about." Chappy gives Uncle Al a long hug, and then sends him back to the farmhouse so she can continue her watch.</p>
        <p>Nyoma takes next watch, and carefully uses Kevin to patrol the surrounding pasture and cornfields to watch for the creatures. They hide in the corn and only appear as rustling stalks here and there, but they seem to be systematically testing the walls, moving in groups to strike at possible weak points throughout the night. During Bount's watch, for which Clash comes along, something altogether stranger occurs. Several times Bount and Clash hear the voice of Nyoma out in the corn: "Bount, help! I need help! I am all alone here!" Bount tests the voice three times: asking who is with her, asking about their past together, and asking her just to state his full name. Each time the voice, pitch perfect as Nyoma's voice, simply repeats: "I am alone. Please help! I need help." Bount and Clash debate, but again decide not to pursue. Eventually the voice stops, and both the tabaxi and the goblin are left disquieted. "I don't know if that was the right thing to do," Bount says, pausing. "Hey, Clash. I honestly don't know if we are going to get out of all this. If something happens to me out here, would you promise me that you'll see to it I get some kind of headstone? Something to remember me by?" Clash smiles grimly and responds, "Don't worry, friend. I'll get you the nicest scrap wood headstone planted right above a fresh earth gravestone beside an outside ever seen. Don’t you worry at all."</p>
        <p>In the morning, the group resolves to head to Old Owl Well, to seek help from the wizard and other fellow there and to see if they have any answers here. There is more than a little suspicion about the pair, and in fact Chappy suggests that possibly these two are in fact the cause of the demonic spillover into the material plane. While Chappy and Bount debate this, Nyoma pulls Big Al aside and suggests a plan during the light parts of the day to cull portions of the corn. "It would mean less cover for the gnolls to attack your walls." Alphonse thinks it's a capital idea, and agrees to get people on it right away. Shortly after breakfast, Bount, Chappy, and Nyoma depart for Old Owl Well. Clash for her part, disguised as a halfling, decides to remain behind for safety sake, feeling her inability to keep up with the others during the fight with the hyena-things in the Conyberry outskirts.</p>
        <p>The group heads south into the foothills, until they see a low mound topped with a crumbled old watchtower and a partially remaining tumbledown barrier wall. The three sneak up the hill, where they spot a tall fancy red tent pitched beside the tower, of which the first floor is still intact. Spotting some figures wandering about inside the tower, Bount sneaks up to get a better look. As he approaches the wall itself, he sees that the figures rummaging around inside the tower are animated skeletons, nearly a dozen or so! But he also slips on the gravel of the hillside, alerting the undead to his presence. They slowly shuffle outside of the building toward Bount, until Chappy, thinking quickly, magically invokes a minor illusion of the tabaxi on the other edge of the ring, positioned just over a small cliff. The skeletons take the bait and shuffle after the illusion, with eventually the first few throwing themselves off the small cliff and becoming pulverized at the bottom.</p>
        <p>At this noise, the two men in the tent emerge. One is short and pudgy, clad in a bespoke red robe, bald and with a tattoo on his forehead. The other is a tall thin man in subtle black leathers. "My skeletons!" Wails the bald man in a high tremulous whine. Bount remains hidden, but Chappy and Nyoma approach forth. The pair of men introduce themselves as Hamun the Red, wizard and official member of the Magical Bureau of Thay, and his companion Nine-Fingers Jasper. Nyoma and Chappy converse with the two for a long while, finding Hamun garrulous and willing to share, but he is continually shut up by the slightly sinister and altogether too suave Jasper, who insists on not providing information without getting something in return. Bounty of Nonsense keeps himself hidden, and in fact begins maneuvering around the hillside stealthily to the back of the pair's tent. </p>
        <p>Hamun the Red and Nine-Fingers Jasper seem entirely unconcerned both with the locals, Big Al's farmstead, and in fact even the sun having seemingly disappeared, in favor of their own personal researches into a very ancient object located in Conyberry. They both display a kind of casually blasé reaction to the idea of innocent lives being in danger. Jasper offers to help the locals in exchange for some assistance with a quick trip into Conyberry for their work. But Chappy and Nyoma beg off, pleading that they have too many things to do. Yet they do keep the pair busy while Bounty of Nonsense slips silently into their tent. The tabaxi rogue examines the cluttered interior, packed with magical equipment, books, maps, notes, and various objects and random things. He fills his arms with the most intriguing things he spots: a map scribbled over with comments, a book, a scrollcase, and a medium-sized lockbox. Then, again as quietly as he possibly can, he books it out of the tent and down the hill. Somehow, possibly as a combination of his skill at stealth and the tent's occupants being distracted in conversation, he gets away entirely unnoticed! Seeing him run down the hill, Nyoma and Chappy quickly end their conversation with the pair and bid them farewall, none too warmly. As they are well and truly away from the hill, they hear just on the edge of their hearing a truly raucous hue and cry from the camp. They hurry into the distance, off and away.</p>

        <p>Nyoma, Chappy, Bounty of Nonsense, and Clash take shelter in a deep cleft between two looming foothills several miles away from the camp of Hamun Kost the Red and Nine-Fingers Jasper. Taking a moment to breath after fleeing from the tent, Bount turns to the other two: "So, those guys... were they cool?" Nyoma stares at him and pauses before responding, "No, Bount. They were definitely not cool. I mean, Hamun wanted to talk I guess, but his friend very clear would not let him.  His friend was kind of threatening, honestly." Bount: "Huh. Oh, well. At least we have this stuff to go through!"</p>
        <p>The three examine the objects the tabaxi lifted from the tent. They include a journal-plus-spellbook and a scroll case, which Nyoma latches on to, the small ornate lockbox, with Bount takes, and a large map of the region with hand-drawn annotations in red ink, which Chappy studies. Nyoma finds written incantations that she deems useful for herself, while Bount carefully picks the box's lock. Inside they find some mysterious liquids in vials – potions! - and an intricately beautiful, ancient shiny metal ring. The tabaxi pops the ring onto his finger, and he is able to feel the power sparking off the ring even without knowing more.</p>
        <p>Poring over the map, Chappy speaks up, "Hey, look here – it says, 'door, substantial ichor.' Something tells me that's where we should be heading next." The attention of the group is now drawn. Bount points at something to the north, in Neverwinter Wood, "What is this drawn here? It looks like a bird next to a house, right? That reminds me of that hunter we heard about. His name was Falcon, right?" As they discuss, the tabaxi seems intrigued with the hunter, but the other two press the importance of trying to help Alphonse and the locals around here. They continue to try and decrypt the slightly mysterious markings on the map. "Is that a dragon over a castle?" asks Chappy, leaning and squinting at something over the Sword Mountains. "It looks like it," Nyoma replies, "And over there, one over the Wood also." The tabaxi quickly cuts in, "I'd like to remind everyone of our previously stated strict no dragon hunting policy!"</p>
        <p>As they finish with the map, Nyoma summarizes her finding from the journal. She explains Hamun and Nine Fingers Jasper were investigating a millenia-past conflict between giants and dragons, which they believe could be better understood with the assistance of some "Great Stone." The red wizard seemed to believe that stone played a role in the decimation of Conyberry. The pair were at Old Owl Well looking for archaeological clues related to Conyberry, but the only significant find they had uncovered was an ancient ring from the Empire of Nethril. At this, the tiefling spots the ring on Bount's finger. She inquires, "Excuse me, Bount? Could I ask where you go that?" The tabaxi: "Oh, yeah, this. It was in the lockbox! I don't know what it is, but I do know I like how it makes me feel. This ring is great." Nyoma: "That's fantastic. You know I can identify objects like that with my powers, right? Maybe you should let me try?" It takes some convincing to get Bount to take the ring off, and even after he does so he manages to foul one attempt by Nyoma to identify it with constant pestering, but she eventually uncovers the ancient artifact is a Ring of Protection.</p>
        <p>The group eventually decides to bed down for the night, before heading south to the mountain door.</p>
        <p>A few dozen miles away and three days ago, Pandjed has bid farewell to his companions in Phandalin and must find his own way out of town. He happens on a horse owned by a villager. Staring at the horse for a while, the dragonborn is mometarily torn over the ethics of taking the animal for his own benefit. He pulls out his coin purse, and removes 15 gold pieces. "A fair price for a horse, when the exchange assists one directed by prophecy," the paladin thinks to himself. And away he rides, out of Phandalin to the east. He keeps an eye out for his companions and searches for them for a few hours, but he does not encounter them. Deciding this is the hand of fate, and that if they are to meant to meet again it will surely happen, Pandjed rides out to the east. He travels to the place he came here to seek out: the Shrine of Savras, sacred and defiled.</p>
        <p>Back at the present time, it is now morning. After a quick and simple breakfast of porridge, Bount, Nyoma, and Chappy walk south. They travel up and down rolling foothills that slowly increase in height, as they broach the true beginnings of the upswell of the Sword Mountains. About mid-afternoon, the trio crests the top of a hill and are shocked to see Pandjed the dragonborn paladin riding along the lower edge of the hill, deliberately and with purpose, completel unaware of them. They shout and wave happily, and the dragonborn turns to spot them, shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand. Pandjed waves and says nothing. The trio quickly runs down the hill toward him. </p>
        <p>The reunion between Pandjed and the other three involves excited babbling on their parts as they explain the momentous events of the last few days, and taciturn silence from the paladin. Pandjed asks just one question, "What happened to my horse?" Nyoma responds, "Well, we tried to do our best by the horses, but when we got the barrier around Big Al's they couldn't bring the horses in. They even wanted to eat them, but we wouldn't let them do that! So... hopefully they ran off and are enjoying grass in a field somewhere?" The dragonborn just looks down and away with a neutral expression on his face: "My poor horse." Chappy says to Bount, sotto voce: "You know, I forgot how weird this guy is." But Bount speaks up to the whole group, "No offense, but how do we know Pandjed is who he says he is? I mean seriously no offense, but some of the things that have happened to me in the last day or two..." It takes the group a while to convince the tabaxi, and he even quizzes Pandjed a time or two to verify his identify. Bount then begins pondering how unlikely it is that they have found each other again, trying to rationalize and see it as something likely to happen. Pandjed just interjects, "This is the will of the Gods."</p>
        <p>The group, now numbering five with Clash, continues south. At what would otherwise be dusk – since the sun has continued to refuse to appear in the sky, casting the entire day as dusk at lightest – they reach their destination, and are confronted by two massive 40 foot high bulwarks of smooth solid stone extending from the mountain, divided by an iron portcullis with a great set of double doors beyond it. They peer through the portcullis, and Nyoma is able to read an inscription hastily carved into the door: "THIS WAS ONCE DUNNSALA. NOW IT IS NOTHING. THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU HERE. LEAVE QUICKLY AND NEVER RETURN." Perhaps expectedly, this does not dissuade them, though Clash eagerly offers to go scout out a safe place in which to set up camp outside. Chappy notices one or two chimneys poking above a ridge up the mountainside. But the bulwarks also possess arrow slits just large enough for a halfling to pass through, and the others eventually convince Chappy to climb in and take a look, with Nyoma coming shortly after via magical means.</p>
        <p>Chappy squeezes through, finding herself in a dark and chaotic room. Nyoma appears in a cloud of mist in the room beside Chappy, and creates magical light on the halfling's wide-brimmed pointed hat to illuminate the space. The room is strewn with debris, but seems to have played a role in the defense of the fortress, with large wooden ballistae against each arrow slit. The two locate a winch and are able to raise the portcullis, but Bount and Pandjed still find themselves behind the set of double doors. "We'll wait here while you find a way to get this open," Bounty of Nonsense calls out. Turning back to Pandjed, he says, "So, um... this god thing. How is that working?" Nyoma and Chappy square up against a door leading out of the current room, preparing to explore in order to find their way back to the doors.</p>
        <p>The halfling bard sneaks her way down a hallway, finding herself in some kind of receiving room that used to be nicely appointed with now-rotten carpets and tapestries and small wall decorations, seemingly of a religious nature. The room is also decorated with piles of bones. And as Chappy steps foot into the room, the piles assemble themselves into grotesque undead hunched hyena shapes! Nyoma rushes into the room, and she and Chappy engage in battle while yelling to their compatriots. Hearing their yells on the edge of their heading, Pandjed and Bount suddenly realize the urgency of the situation and begin desperately thundering against the door, attempting to break it down. After several attempts the double doors splinter and break open, allowing the pair to enter a great hall with a cavernously tall ceiling. The tabaxi and the dragonborn rush through a door to the west into the receiving room to help their friends, with Bount slamming the door behind them.</p>
        <p>The four vigorously battle the animated gnoll skeletons, but they hear an ominously loud crash and bang from somewhere in the direction of the great hall. Unable to spare much attention from the slashing and biting of the ravenous piles of bones and rags, they focus on the matter at hand. But just as the last of the bone creatures has been pounded to dust, a violent banging is heard against the doors leading to the receiving room. Bount tries to block the door, but before he can get himself properly set the doors slam open, allowing a tidal wave of rotten fur and flesh and black ichor dripping from hungering mouths access to the room. More gnolls have come to dine. </p>
        <p>A long, desperate struggle is fought against the gnolls, eventually spilling out into the middle of the great hall. At last the gnolls have been vanquished, and the adventurers are bloody and dirty and more or less covered in the black oily viscous that the gnolls seem to continuously ooze. They take shelter behind a pillar in the corner to rest. Bount lies on the ground, recovering from his wounds, and Chappy subtly reaches out and scratches him behind the ears. The tabaxi hesitates for just a second or two, before purring ever so slightly. After a few minutes of this, Bount looks up at Chappy, "What was that spell you cast on me? Heroism? That was... wow. It was like being tipsy, but in the best way. But also strange, so strange." While resting, they assess the grand room they find themselves in. Aside from the now-destroyed double doors leading out to the north, there are three smaller sets of double doors in this room, each in cardinal directions and each topped with a sigil in the lintel above carved as a bas relief in stone. The doors to the west – to the receiving room – carry a sigil of a crystal ball marked by an eye in the center. "That is of Savras, God of Propecy and to whom I have sworn my service," intones Pandjed. The doors to the south are marked by a carving of a gemstone underneath the outline of a mountain, and to the east is a sigil of a ring of alchemical and mathematical symbols and formulae. Nyoma considers them for a second, then explains, "I've definitely read about these before. The gemstone represents Dumathoin, Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain. He's the patron diety of shield dwarves. Probably the chief god in this place. And the other one, that's a gnome god of invention called Nebelun the Meddler. A lot of people think he's just an aspect of Gond, but no one really knows."</p>
        <p>After resting for nearly an hour, the four decide to continue exploring to the west. Returning to the receiving room, they examine the three doors in the room and pick one at random. It leads to toilets, shielded with chainmail curtains. Bount grabs a curtain momentarily, before realizing the strength of the stench attached to it, upon which he discards it. They then head north, through a particularly fancing decorated set of doors. They find themselves in a disguting mess of a room that was clearly once ornately decorated and arranged: the Shrine of Savras. The floor and all surfaces are covered both in oily black ichor and in grayish sticky thick mucus. In the middle of the room is a vast crystal ball, absolutely slathered in mucus, and around the edges are small tables and bookcases and other surfaces piled with ritual objects, prognosticatory devices, books, papers, and miscellanea, now strewn about.  And at the other end of the room a raised stone dais, upon which lies a massive, grotesque distorted frog-thing. The frog-thing rests its head against a baroquely carved stone altar, and on top of the altar sits a shining white warhammer, the sole object totally clean in this chaos. The froglike creature stares at the group with massive bulging eyes and growls aggressively. Pandjed, his face a mask of passion and anger, charges into the room at the frog. His companions join him in battle.</p>
        <p>Pandjed leaps toward the frog, with Bount behind him. But the frog suddenly dematerializes in the dim light, and pops back into existence beside the crystal ball, behind the tabaxi. It stands on hind legs momentarily, and attempts to close its wet rubbery jaws around the rogue, but he slips out of the way at the last moment. Pandjed and the others turn around and rain blows down upon the frog, trying to get it away from Bount. It zips out of reality again, this time surprising Nyoma by popping back in almost on top of her. This time it is able to grip the tiefling with its tongue and pulls her bodily into its mouth. Gulping a deep horrible thrum, Nyoma disappears as the frog-thing swallows. At this, Pandjed's eyes shine with determination. He storms out of the room, and gripping his flail with intensity, he channels every ounce of the divine power given to him by Savras into a single blow. It connects, and the frog monster explodes! The receiving room is covered in mucus and frog flesh and there is Nyoma, largely unharmed by entirely shocked, on the floor and covered in gunk.</p>
        <p>The four return to the room. Pandjed takes the warhammer and studies it, while Chappy sets to magically cleaning the Shrine. Nyoma offers to take the warhammer and spends a while communing with its energies. Handing it back to Pandjed, she informs him, "It's the Lightbringer. I read about this, it's a powerful mysitcal artifact that was once used to protect the Forge of Spells before both the Forge and the hammer were lost."</p>
        <p>As this is happening, Bount heads back to the room with the arrow slits to see if there has been any change outside. It is night, and the ominous cloud cover continues. Returning and reporting that nothing seems to have changed, the tabaxi suddenly seems overwhelmed. "What are we even doing here? Is this actually something we can do anything about? Maybe we should just get out of here." The others do their best to convince him of their purpose here. Nyoma says, "It's good we're here. Even if we haven't figured out how to bring the sun back, we've been able to help Pandjed do what he came here to do. We were able to cleanse this shrine!" Bount replies, "Yeah, that's all well and good. There just seems so much horribleness and so much danger here. What, are there two more shrines? Is it all going to be more horrible frog monsters and biting jaws and blood and death? Maybe we just need to find someone here to talk to, reason with here. Maybe we could... I don't know, convince them to leave?" Chappy seems skeptical: "What are you talking about Bount? What would we even say?" Bount: "I don't know! We could lie to them, we could get them to go somewhere else!" Chappy gawps at him, "My family is in danger here! You want to just kick this down the road for someone else to deal with?"</p>
        <p>The tabaxi looks chagrined and says, "No, of course not. I just, I just want to know what we're getting into here. Not on faith, but on evidence. I know you all have a lot of faith about what we're doing, can't we combine the power of faith with the knowledge of being able to handle what's to come?" Nyoma: "If we can even find that knowledge." Chappy: "Yeah, how, Bount?" The tabaxi shrugs his shoulders, "Like I said, I don't know. I just didn't expect all this. We started out doing one thing and then we have to do this and that and that and I just didn't anticipate all this when I signed up to move some cargo to get out of Neverwinter for a while!" Pandjed pipes up: "… I did not anticipate the frog." This causes the others to suddenly collapse into laughter, breaking the tension. As a way to help calm his nerves, Nyoma offers Bount The Mask Within, so that he might be able to use it to detect sapient thoughts and be better warned about any surprises to come. He takes it graciously, thanking her, and as the group settles down for a good rest and some sleep, he pulls some paints out of his disguise kit. Calmly and methodically, he carefully paints feline whiskers and fur on the mask, matching his own.</p>

        <p>A sudden rumble of the earth shakes Nyoma out of her quiet meditative trance. It is early morning, and Chappy, Bount, and Pandjed all startle awake as the ground quakes beneath them and a low rumbling can be heard at a distance. The tiefling had been communing with the prophecy-god Savras in the way most familiar to her, giving thanks for sheltering in the now-recovered Shrine by ritually dictating recent events and knowledge in prayer. Bount, squinting his eyes on waking and trying to make sense of the situation, looks over at Nyoma and, seeing the slightly panicked look on her face, tries to make sense of things: "Did you do this? Is this, a, er, a magic thing?" Nyoma yells back, "I don't think so! It shouldn’t be! But - " she is cut off by the sudden ceasing of the earth's shifting beneath their feet. A short slightly panicked conversation ensues, followed by the eventual resolve – or resignation in the case of the tabaxi – to finish exploring the rest of the abandoned dwarven fortress-temple of Dunnsala, to try and seek the source of the quaking.</p>
        <p>Nyoma sends Kevin to the main hall, where the owl detects a smaller low moaning behind the southern exit from the hall. The group cautiously approaches, and opens the southern exit to find themselves in a short narrow hallway leading to a second set of doors. These doors are completely covered in the viscous black ichor seen elsewhere in the temples and across the region – except here, the oily black substance seems to be seeping out of the TOP of the door, as if being dribbled out by some gravity-defying fountain and flowing across the ceiling and upper walls outside. Baffled, the group once again pauses, before Bount pulls out The Face Within and slides it over his face, extending his thoughts south toward the omnipresent moaning. He detects a small, pale gray presence, pulsating slowly, but any further concentration that is suddenly ceased by an overpowering black malevolence around the edges of the tabaxi's perception. The rogue is almost overwhelmed by this, but it largely increases the curiosity of the others and their desire to see more. Finally, Nyoma grows impatient and moves forward, flinging open the second set of doors with magical force.</p>
        <p>The sight awaiting the group inside is shocking. As if the fortress-temple beyond them has been broken up into chunks and digested into some obscenely massive black-hued stomach, islands of stone floor and broken walls float and bob slowly in all-surrounding sea-sphere of dark ichor. The ichor spans gaps in the floor, but also covers most of the outer walls and the ceilings, and the flow of ichor seems to flow upward in defiance of all natural laws. Before being broken up, this room was clearly once a throne room, with a central island sporting three dwarf-sized thrones. And in the center, a pillar of black ooze extends from the ceiling down to the stone throne, and in the ooze is suspended an ancient skeletal corpse wearing a brass crown and, seemingly, a living, moaning, unconscious individual intertwined with the skeleton.</p>
        <p>The tall figure hanging from the ooze, suspending in mid-air along with the once-royal skeleton, wears a long coat with some kind of rigidness hidden underneath, and a long thin sword in a scabbard at his side. The four others pause for a moment agape at the sight in front of them, before Nyoma raises her hand and extends a wave of positive arcane force toward the figure, rousing him to consciousness. His eyes flip open, he struggles, and realizing his situation, he screams incoherently momentarily before deciding to narrow the scream to a set of specific words: "Where am I, and what did YOU do to me?!" There is momentary confusion between the long-coated individual, still strung up in the ooze, and the party, but eventually the tiefling warlock harnesses a sphere of galaxy-energy and unleashes it to cut the sword-wielder down from the ooze. After a tense moment, he introduces himself: "I'm Enoch. I was trying to get something, and... well... I'm honestly not sure what happened. I know this place did not look like this." The party is similarly confused, but they introduce themselves in turn. Bount specifically majestically draws his rapier with a theatrical flourish and announces himself as Bount of Nonsense, honored officer of the Flaming Fist Mercenary Company. Enoch watches this, and lets out a sharp surprised laugh to see such drama in these surroundings. The tabaxi seems displeased.</p>
        <p>After freeing Enoch, the five together take notice of a strange mural behind the thrones. In a two-dimensional profile it seems to depict a long mountain ridge with a forest in front of and below the ridge. On the left hand side of the mountain ridge is the dwarven Law rune, and on the right hand side are both the dwarven Creation and Human runes. In the forest, atop the center of the mountain, and above the Human rune are raised carved polyhedral shapes, each one a different polyhedron. And above the Law rune is an inverted polyhedral space or socket of sorts. Chappy and Nyoma both begin excitedly discussing this find, with Nyoma musing, "It looks like a puzzle! Maybe we have to find this last shape and place it in the mural? But wait, this shape over the Human rune looks like the pyramid-shaped polyhedron we already have, but bigger? We couldn't fit it in here." Chappy squints with thought, before opining, "I think it's supposed to be more illustrative than actual, Nyoma." The tiefling warlock seems unsatisfied with his idea.</p>
        <img src="./images/session_7_mural.jpg" className="session-img img-shadow" alt="Session 7 Mural" />
        <p>But further consideration is cut off by another greater quaking of the ground beneath them, sending the islands of floor shifting unpleasantly in the black up-dripping ichor. A deep violent rumbling is heard off to the east, followed by an explosion, and followed shortly after by THINGS crawling up out of the ichorous muck! Horrific gross parodies of form, giant fang-mawed mouths with stumpy legs and eyes dangling from compound-jointed stalks, suddenly swim up out of the black oily viscousness and set themselves upon the characters! The four plus Enoch dispatch them easily enough, with Bounty of Nonsense launching several arrows into the creatures before casting his bow down and entering the fray with sword and dagger. As the five seem to be getting the better of the maw-demons, the earth once more quakes and an even louder explosive noise is heard once more. Bount, with feline grace, launches himself onto the east-most throne-room island and, using his claws for traction, leans himself around the broken wall to get a glimpse at the even more disconcerting sight awaiting them.</p>
        <p>The source of rumbling is a large room-chunk floating in the corruptive filth, in the center of which is a bizarre object shaped almost like a halfing-sized bronze coffin, inscribed with a myriad of esoteric pictograms and surrounded by a whirling blurred cloud of ominously shaped and inscribed pieces of metal, wood, gems, and other less identifiable materials. From within the obviously old but still shining artifact is some kind of central humanoid-shaped glow, and it is from this that occasional explosions and rumbles issue forth. With each rumble a rainbow-hued lightning bolt arcs from within the glowing center, and where the bolt lands, a sudden gout of black filth erupts from the interceding surface. But also around this object is a swirling melee, as a gigantic five-armed golem is surrounded by cackling, shrieking gnolls, trying to bite and tear at the metal behemoth as it attempts to throw them from the platform. "YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED," the golem intones in a grinding atonal satire of a voice, its head swiveling all the way around the face the tabaxi leaning around the wall. </p>
        <p>"Uh, guys?" Bounty of Nonsense calls back, "I found the... ooze shooter?" "What the hell is that?" Chappy yells over. The tabaxi turns back around momentarily, "Well, it's, ah. It's bad – and it's mad. It's bad and mad." The halfling looks at the ground for a second, just for a second, before responding: "Then that sounds like what we have to deal with to stop all of this. Let's go." And for once, Bount just nods, and they do.</p>
        <p>The five begin making their way to the central room-chunk with Pandjed leading the way, but end up held at a choke point, the remnant of a narrow tunnel, now without walls and floating as the only point of connection between the throne-room islands and where the artifact, golem, and gnolls sit. There another maw-demon climbs out of the ichor to assault Pandjed Seeing them approach, some of the gnolls maneuver away from the golem and being peppering the group with arrows. Pandjed is able to handily shrug these off, batting them away with his shield as he strikes at the maw-demon with the hammer Lightbringer. But the maw-demon accomplishes splitting the group, as Pandjed eventually makes the leap to the central island while Enoch, Chappy, Bount, and Nyoma find themselves battling gnolls on a long twisting remnant of a staircase, tilting dangerously over in the oily black muck.</p>
        <p>Chappy and Nyoma race to the top of the stairs, gaining a vantage point on the central island and seeking to do anything they can to help Pandjed there. The halfling squares up, and looks over at Nyoma: "I can't believe I'm finally getting to use this!" The tiefling looks back quizzically as the bard flips over her lute and begins to beat percussively on the underside of the instrument. Chappy intones in a flat affect: "Hammer calls you! Tongs call you! Be born once more!" And all of a sudden, the golem begins to glow white-hot, with waves of heat streaming off its surface and bending the air around it. The grinding metallic voice now becomes a cacophony of broken syllables, but it continues to battle on against the gnolls, searing the hyenas as it grabs them. But in this tumult it seems not to notice Pandjed on the other end of the island, trading hammer blows for glaive swipes with a massively large gnoll, snarling orders at the other smaller half-living hyena creatives. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile further below down the stairs, Enoch and Bount fend off gnolls climbing up out of the viscous ooze to overwhelm them. They are joined by Chappy as she descends the tilting, careening stairs, and Bount looks over his shoulder toward the top of the stairs. "Hey, new guy!" He motions to Enoch, "Take this!" He throws Enoch a potion, before retreating up the stairs. There the tabaxi joins Nyoma, who is sending blasts of magical force down to the central island to assist with the melee there. Bount points at the artifact: "Nyoma. Look at this, I noticed it when I was watching before." the artifact once again rumbles and explodes, a chunk of the whirling debris surrounding it actually flies off and away, leading to another lightning arc and another spout of ichor where the arc lands. "See how part of it comes away? I think maybe, possibly, if we could destroy that thing that would help? Or make this way worse? I don't know, but I left my bow back there..." He does not get to continue, for in this moment the massive gnoll below gouges Pandjed grievously, and the paladin hits the ground, unconscious. Nyoma thinks for a moment, before quickly reaching behind her and handing the tabaxi a hand crossbow and some bolts. "Sure, okay. You try that. I've got to go do something massively, incredibly stupid. Wish me luck!" And with that, the warlock vanishes into thin air at the top of the stairs and remanifests on the central island, not far from Pandjed's fallen body.</p>
        <p>The combat rages on. Enoch and Chappy valiantly try to hold off the gnolls at the bottom of the stairs, with Enoch only barely hanging onto consciousness as they battle on. Nyoma swings wildly with her mystically-enhanced staff, trying at the same time to both beat away the gnolls and heal Pandjed back into consciousness. Bount carefully aims the crossbow, and fires into the glowing heart of the artifact once, then twice. Each time yet more whirling pieces break off and fly away, and greater and greater multicolored lightning arcs appear to wreak havoc. Nyoma is able to once wake Pandjed, but he is struck by this lightning before hitting the ground once more. Another gnoll latches its jaws into Chappy's shoulder, and she swoons and falls as well. Enoch faces two gnolls at once, clutching his side desperately to staunch the bleeding. He shrugs off his coat and throws it on top of Chappy's fallen form, granting to her some measure of protection, in what he presumes is one of the last decisions he will ever make. Finally, Bounty of Nonsense launches one final crossbow bolt directly into the center of the glowing light and heat of the whirling coffin-like device, and the entire room disappears in a sudden bright white immolation of cold fire.</p>
        <p>In a few moments, the all-consuming light recedes. The five blink and squint and, at last, are able to assess the situation. The golem is in pieces, and all of the gnolls are no more than oily black stains on the stone floor. The artifact is destroyed, but among a scattering of twisted bronze and shattered occult components is the withered, desiccated husk of a humanoid that seems to have once been a gnome, as well as a brilliant blue eight-sided rune-inscribed polyhedron nestled between the remnants of what would have once been the husk's hands. But more alarmingly, the ooze on which the islands float – and which coats the walls and ceilings – is rippling ominously, backed by a threating and increasingly loud rumbling down deep. Enoch yells from the bottom of the stairs, "I think it's time to GO!" Bount points at the blue object and calls to Nyoma, "Grab that!" Nyoma meanwhile is running at a full clip and shouts back, "Already on it!"  The five leap from island to island over the ichor, and manage to flee back into the main hall just as the ceiling begins to give out, closing the way behind them with massive rubble and debris.</p>
        <p>After a few moments of shocked silence, Nyoma pipes up: "Can we... rest?" But Bount swings to face Enoch and says, "Can we find out who you are? I mean, I appreciate the help, but I'd still like to know." The swordsman responds, "Like I said before, my name is Enoch. I came here to recover certain lost magical artifacts for the library of my King in a distant land. And now that I have this," he raises the signet ring he took from the hand of the skeleton on the throne, "And now THAT is over and done with, I'd like to go find the treasure I came here for. Though... I'm pretty sure all the stairs in this place were in the part that's now fallen down." And with that, Enoch moves to eye the second-floor balcony in the main hall, gathering some ropes to climb it, as Bount studies him. He heads off to find his treasure, but Nyoma instructs Kevin the Owl to accompany him. A few minutes later, Nyoma is narrating the contents of a chest Enoch had located - "Oh, Chappy! There's a lute there, it's beautiful... all filigreed with silver!" - that is, until the tabaxi interrupts them: "Wait, everyone. Look at the windows. Sunlight!" And indeed, the upper-level windows shine with bright sunlight of the sort the party hasn't seen for days.</p>
        <p>After Enoch returns, and hesitantly agrees to lend Chappy the lute he found – clearly thrumming with arcane power – in exchange for them saving his life, the five rest for roughly an hour before determining to leave this accursed place they have occupied for the last two days. "But first, let's uh, well let's make sure the coast is clear," says Bounty of Nonsense. He sneaks gingerly up to the destroyed double entrance doors, before peering out of the murky interior down the entranceway and out into the field beyond. And his worst fears are realized. Out of the fortress, Bount counts maybe a dozen figures, though it's hard to tell at this distance. And accompanying the figures, a call rings out from the field: "Oh, intrepid 'venturers! Please do come outside, that we might be properly acquainted." The clipped tones quite clearly belong to none other than Iarno Albrek.</p>

        <p><i>In a quick flashback to before the party discovered Iarno outside Dunnsala, they explored the bedroom of a priest of Savras who worked and lived in Dunnsala in ages past. There they found the priest's diary, which is included here:</i></p>
        <img src="./images/session_8_diary.jpg" className="session-img img-shadow" alt="Session 8 Diary" />
        <p>Iarno's presence outside the dwarven fortress causes general panic among the party of Bounty of Nonsense, Nyoma, Chappy, Pandjed, and Enoch. Sneaking up to peer outward, Enoch and Bount spy a collection of figures. Glasstaff herself, but also Hamun Kost the Red and Nine-Fingers Jasper, over half a dozen ambulatory skeletons, and two hobgoblin soldiers flanking a hostage: Clash. "I have your goblin," Iarno loudly calls down the dark entrance passage to the fortress. "I do not want this to come to violence. I only want to speak with you concerning what you have taken from me. Return it and we can be cordial with each other." </p>
        <p>In response to seeing Clash there, the tabaxi immediately flees back inside, breathing in panicked syncopation. Bount tears away from the others and climbs the rope to the second floor, searching for some other kind of exit. Chappy and Nyoma catch up to him as he finds a decent-sized hole in the ceiling, with the rotted remnants of some aged climbing gear and a rope dangling down to the floor where they are. The halfling and the tiefling try to calm Bount down, but he agonizedly unravels his guilt and anxiety over how they seem to go from bad to worse over and over, and this time he feels like he has endangered Clash. Chappy tries to calm him down, "Listen. We are all in this together, and we'll figure out how to get Clash out of this." She looks down at the new silver-filigreed lute in her hand, it still thrumming occult harmonic vibrations up and down her arms. "You know... I think I can get you up there to the top. And then when you're there, I also think I can keep them from seeing you. You can get close to Clash!" Bount: "Is this some magic nonsense again? I'm sorry, but no. No. I just can't." They retreat back to the first floor.  </p>
        <p>The group hurriedly debates options. Enoch demands to know who Iarno is. "Well," starts Nyoma, "she is someone we made really unhappy. We took some of her things, see. But we were completely justified, she was overseeing a gang squeezing the life out of this town!" Enoch nods, "And the other wizard-looking guy?" Chappy this time: "We... also made them pretty angry. Completely separate event from Iarno, but we also took their stuff. In our defense there, they kind of deserved it for being shitty." Enoch responds, "Wow. You all sure carve a path. Hm. Obviously, I don't believe she's up to any good. One does not bring walking skeletons for diplomacy. What to do about that hostage, though?" Bount: "I have no idea. If we go out there, they will kill Clash. There is NOTHING we can do here." Pandjed considers that a moment before piping up in his typical monotone, "Ah, but once they kill the hostage, then the advantage of their hostage will be gone. They won't have leverage anymore." This does not seem to convince the others.</p>
        <p>At least, Chappy convinces Bount to give her initial plan a go. She and Bount return to the second floor, along with Nyoma who takes up a position at an arrow slot on the second floor outer wall. At the same time, Enoch and Pandjed proceed outward to try to bluff Iarno. Enoch claims he and his dragonborn companion have not seen those the wizard is seeking, but that he and Pandjed are capable with arms and could be valuable to Iarno if hired to assist her. She responds positively but impatiently, and increasingly so as Enoch attempts to spin out the negotiations to buy the others more time. Up above, Bount of Nonsense looks at the halfling bard with trepidation and anxiety run rampant. Chappy begins to pluck the lute in an airy melody of increasing tempo, and before he even realizes it, the tabaxi has been lifted several inches off the air! He only barely manages to keep himself from shouting in alarm, and grits his teeth for what is to come as he slowly floats up and out of the room onto the ledge at the top. Chappy's tune changes to a slippery, mercurial ballad and Bount suddenly realizes he can no longer see his hands in front of his face! He is now somehow impossible to see. Marveling at this but aware of what must be done, he steals away down the cliffside to Iarno's group and Clash below.</p>
        <p>As Bounty of Nonsense places himself right behind the two hobgoblins flanking Clash, Iarno is beginning to get increasingly aggravated with Enoch and Pandjed's prevarication and stalling tactics. Finally, the tabaxi summons up his courage and rushes forward, stabbing one hobgoblin and barreling the other off the short ridge they were standing on. He then turns and begins bounding off into the trees nearby, shouting at Clash as he does so: "RUN! NOW!" But Clash does not move. She does not even shift to register Bount's voice, or his presence, or the hobgoblin dead on the ground or the other one tumbling down the ridge. Chappy, who has placed herself at an arrow slot on the first floor peering outward at the events, suddenly feels her blood run ice-cold. "No. Oh, NO. Clash was an illusion all along!"</p>
        <p>In response to this sudden turn of events, all hell breaks loose. The hobgoblin rolling down the ridge lets out a shout and a cry, and suddenly Iarno, Hamun, Jasper, and the skeletons take notice of the feline rogue that is now sprinting on all fours away toward thicker tree cover to the west. Iarno screams out a command to the other two: "Get him! Do not let him escape!" And Jasper tears off at speed after Bounty of Nonsense. Hamun speaks in a grating arcane speech laced with iron, and the collection of skeletons lurches alive, turning as one collective entity, off behind the tabaxi. But before any of those clustered near the fortress entrance can do much, an inky black magical darkness engulfs all those present. From the second floor, Nyoma has just unleashed the incantation inscribed on a magical scroll, sucking all available light out of a large area on the ground. Bedlam ensues.  </p>
        <p>In the darkened melee, it is hard to tell friend from foe. Enoch approaches Iarno, claiming to be in service and here to assist her. But when he feels her close enough in the darkness, he silently plunges the long, thin blade of his sword into her side. She chokes out a sudden surprised noise, but can not get much more out before Enoch stabs her again, and again. She stumbles back, and again as Pandjed approaches, and the wizard seems to gather the arcane shadows thickly in her hands, before unleashing them on the dragonborn. The paladin feels the shadows crawl into his mind, and suddenly his worst fear explodes into vision – the oracular crystall ball eye of Savras, cast upon Pandjed with only disappointment and abandonment filling its gaze. The dragonborn cries out, fighting against the shadowy corruption, and swings his hammer as the dark figure commanding the darkness. The hammer encounters resistance in the dark, and Iarno Albrek crumples to the ground. She is broken.</p>
        <p>Outside the dark, Bounty of Nonsense continues to flee from his pursuers. With them hot on his heels, he suddenly hears something trampling through the bushes. "Oh, god. What NOW?" And all at once, a horse emerges from the trees... with Clash on its back! "What are you doing here?!" Bount cries out. "What are YOU doing? What's all this?! Ugh, nevermind, just climb on!" The tabaxi does so, and the goblin begins to turn the horse to ride away from Dunnsala. Bounty puts a hand on her shoulder and grimly says, "No. We can't. At least not yet. The others are still back there. We have to go back." Clash: "Are you kidding me? That really doesn't sound like us." Bount: "I know. And still." Clash wheels the horse back around, toward the fray.  </p>
        <p>But fortunately, as the ride up, the darkness dissipates, like steam boiling away all at once. Hamun and Jasper quail when they see the crumpled body of Iarno. Hamun falls to his knees in surrender, and Jasper attempts to flee north into the trees and bushes. Nyoma and Chappy cast some spells just over his head, and Jasper tumbles to his knees in surrender.</p>
        <p>The five have a moment to breath, before considering what to do with their captives. Though Bount wastes no time with one question as he moves Jasper: "So, uh, looks like we finally get to find out. Why nine fingers, eh? You don't have a necklace we should know about, do you?" Jasper looks up at him, "Ugh, that's horrible! What's wrong with you? No! It's the number of lady's rings I took off their fingers. By THEFT." In response to this, everyone pauses. "I don't know what I was expecting, but I feel disappointed," says Chappy. Bount laughs, "Who knew Jasper was such a lady's man? In any case, if you two don't mind it, I think we'll be having a few more questions for you."</p>
