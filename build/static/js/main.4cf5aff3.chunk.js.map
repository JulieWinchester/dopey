React from 'react';\n\nfunction SessionDescriptions(props) {\n  if (props.session === 1) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>It's a bright, sunny, breezy day on the sword coast. It's midmorning, and a trio of travelers are sitting around a cooking fire, with a loaded ox-driven wagon a short distance away. Chappy Quickstep, a halfling in conspicuously new travel leathers, is taking freshly cooked food off the fire. Bounty of Nonsense, a tabaxi in fancy clothing, is reclining prone on his back. And Friendly, a firbolg in simple homespun, is sitting down, munching oats and occasionally offering some to her cow companion. Bount and Friendly chat happily, while Chappy grouses both about wanting to get this job over with and having to endure the gentle teasing of the other two. Eventually the three decide to pack up and move on, Friendly conscientiously ensuring she and her \"new friends\" leave no trace. They are traveling south down the High Road from Neverwinter to parts south, en route to the frontier town of Phandalin on a job to deliver some supplies for a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker and a human named Silder Hallwinter. They are about half a day out from their destination.</p>\n        <p>Heading north on that same high road are two horses, slowly ambling their way along the road. Riding the horses are the tiefling Nyoma Izarren, dressed in teal and gray, and the dragonborn Prexijandilin Pandjet, sporting shining heavy armor and a visibly-displayed shield. Nyoma enthusiastically tries to draw Pandjet into conversation, though as in the previous days of their journey he continues to be relatively taciturn. They have been traveling for weeks, journeying up from the region of Candlekeep and Baldur's Gate on errands toward Phandelin. They have already had their fair share of trouble and unusual events on the road. About midday, they turn eastward onto the Triboar trail which will take them to their rough and tumble destination. The road becomes twisty, and begins to climb into hills that will eventually rise to form the Sword Mountains. Shortly after taking the turn, Pandjet and Nyoma notice a wagon just a short way behind them, moving in the same direction at roughly the same speed. The duo on horseback and the trio on the wagon share genial waves at a distance from each other. Their journey proceeds like this for an hour or so, before they turn a corner and are confronted with the unmistakable sight of two dead horses a hundred yards up the trail.</p>\n        <p>The duo halt their horses and study the scene. A ways up the road, the trail narrows with two sharp escarpments topped with trees leaning in on both sides. The two dead horses are laid out on the tightest part of the path, decorated with numerous arrows apiece. Squinting ahead, Pandjet is able to pick out several figures only slightly hidden among the trees of the ridges. Nyoma suggests they wait for the wagon behind, to potentially have a bit more support for what lies ahead. Pandjet is concerned as to what those behind could want, but they agree to wait. The trio in the wagon approaches, and friendly greetings are shared on both sides. Friendly and friends seem more than willing to help navigate the (only slightly) hidden lurkers ahead, and the five together travel forward, with the wagon taking the lead. Bount climbs the escarpment on the left side and begins shadowing the main group as they proceed, taking cover in the underbrush.</p>\n        <p>Approaching the narrow point of the path, the three in the wagon and the two on horseback are met by a collection of goblins in simple brown and white uniforms, each with what looks like a shoulder patch insignia of a pair of jaws with sharp, jagged teeth. One goblin in particular, a woman with an abrasive personality and eyes that dart from place to place (who the party will later learn is named Clash), approaches the group and serves as the representative for the others hiding among the trees. She demands the group's traveling papers. An argument ensues in which various characters express incredulity about any need for papers and question exactly where these goblins came from. Clash informs them they are soldiers in the Cragmaw Auxiliary, a military force invited to the area by \"responsible authorities\" to assert law and order on this \"backwards and chaotic\" region. Nyoma tries to talk reason with the goblins, Friendly confusedly mocks them for their demands, and Chappy seems baffled about the goblin's literateness. The argument increases swiftly in tension, without any progress being made.</p>\n        <p>While the rest of the group argues with the Cragmaw soldiers, Bount ascends a tree near the narrow point, where a goblin has taken up a post among the branches with a shortbow trained on the individuals below. Moving swiftly as a breeze, the tabaxi is able to place himself directly behind the solder in the tree, and he claps his hand over the goblin's mouth while threatening aggressively with the guard of his sword. Bounty hisses, \"I will end you unless you stop your friends down there – right now. Drop your weapon.\" The soldier dutifully nods agreement, and drops his weapon. Unfortunately, as they are in a tree, this produces an awful racket as the bow and arrows clatter noisily from branch to branch on their way to the ground. Clash orders the remaining goblins to attack! A noisy confusing melee results. By the time the dust clears, Bount has knocked the goblin in the tree out and to the ground with the guard of his sword, Chappy has strummed sorcerous chords on her lute to lull two of the soldiers into unconsciousness, and a combination of vines summoned by Friendly and a threatened burst of sidereal energy held in the hand of Nyoma force Clash to surrender on behalf of her troops, given she is the only one remaining conscious.</p>\n        <p>With some hesitation, Clash agrees to tell the party anything they want to know. She informs them she is the sergeant of this group of goblins, and they were provided orders to specifically detain Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter and hand them over to someone known as the \"Black Spider.\" Her last understanding was that they had been taken to the local unit encampment, located in a cave five miles northwest, shortly to be moved to their company headquarters at Cragmaw Castle north of Phandelin inside Neverwinter Wood. After some additional questioning, she also reveals the presence of traps along the route. Bount rifles through her pockets discretely, and comes up with a crude handwritten map which he secrets away from the other characters. Friendly forces her to write them authorized travel papers to hopefully avoid this situation again. The five then debate whether or not to travel to the cave HQ or to Phandelin. Pandjet initially seems hesitant, but is convinced by Nyoma and the others to attempt to rescue the hostages. The group sets out northwest.</p>\n        <p>Despite his initial hesitation about the detour, Pandjet confidently takes point and leads the group through the briar patches and copses of trees on the way to their destination. While they travel this way, Bount shows Friendly the map he found, and specifically the worrying room on the map marked \"The Weapon.\" Friendly is less subtle about the secret map than the tabaxi would otherwise like. Unfortunately for Pandjet, for his assertiveness he is paid back by being caught in a snare trap two miles into the hike, though thankfully he ends up unharmed. After this and a comment by Bounty of Nonsense that he has some experience with traps, the others side-eye Bount into taking point. A short while later, he trips the second and final expected hazard, a pit trap, but his agility allows him to sidestep actually being caught in it.</p>\n        <p>Shortly after, the five reach a sharply ascending hill with a large opening, with two large banners bearing the Cragmaw emblem on them. Out of the opening flows a narrow shallow stream. Here the group encounters two goblin soldiers standing guard - they yell \"Who goes there!\" in the midst of the group's debating on a plan of action. Thinking on her feet, Friendly responds they have arrived to take the prisoners to the Black Spider. The guards seem confused, as one of the prisoners has already been transferred! But the group is able to soothe things over and win the trust of the guards. One of the guards escorts them to meet with Yenniw, the corporal and superior officer of this Auxiliary Unit. As they snake their way inside, bordering the stream and climbing a number of stairs as the cave ascends inside the hill, Bounty of Nonsense trails behind. He spots a small set of stairs leading up into the room marked on the map as holding the Weapon, and his curiosity gets the better of him. He blusters and bluffs about needing to check that the entire Unit operations are in ship-shape, and the rest of the group moves on without him, heading around and over a bridge spanning the stream into the large relatively comfortable quarters of the goblins.</p>\n        <p>The remaining four encounter Yenniw in the large, warm, and well-lit living space of the goblins. He is seated at his desk on an upper level of the room, furiously scribbling away at papers. Yenniw has a slick, mean grin on his face and is generally corpulent. They also spot a prone unmoving human-sized figure half-hidden behind a stalagmite, also on the upper level. Friendly takes the lead and reasserts to Yenniw that the group is here to take the prisoner to the Black Spider. The corporal seems quite surprised at this, and replies that he was not aware of any prisoner transfer taking place. Friendly bluffs that there must be something seriously amiss if the Spider is issuing orders through Clash now rather than Yenniw, and that it would be in the corporal's best interest not to anger their shared superior further. Yenniw studies them for a while, but it is not long before his standard sly grin returns to his face. He returns to the group, gripping the edges of his desk with his fingers (moving his finger to press a button on the underside unnoticed by anyone), and informs the group that he will help them out by letting them take the prisoner, if they help him out by doing a routine check on \"the Weapon's containment system.\" Chappy puts on a show of acting baffled, asking Yenniw, \"Do you think this is FUN for us? Just let us do our damn job!\" After some more back and forth, he agrees to let them take the prisoner – Sildar Hallwinter, as it turns out – with them on their way to check the containment system. Everyone agrees to this plan.</p>\n        <p>Meanwhile, Bount spends some time making the acquaintance of the guard stationed at the door to the room where the Weapon is supposed to be located. She gives him some ominous sounding instructions, including maintaining a five foot distance, which he readily agrees to before cautiously stepping inside. The room is quite large, and dark to boot. Creeping forward into the dim chamber, Bounty of Nonsense approaches quite close to what turns out to be a large metal cage. Inside the cage is a forlorn-looking wolf pressed against the floor, growling low. But more importantly, also lurking inside is an eight foot tall powerfully-built hairy creature. It is standing upright and leaning forward menacingly, breathing raggedly and with intense glowing red eyes fixed directly on the tabaxi. Bount's mouth falls open, trying to make sense of the scene. But as he takes it all in, a loud metallic click sounds through the room, and a series of gears begin turning. The last of these gears whirrs as it unlocks and swings open the main front door of the cage. The thing inside exhales a low rumbled moan, while the wolf's growl increases in intensity. With a surprisingly smoothness and quietness, the creature that is apparently the weapon lifts a javelin lying nearby the cage and hurls it at Bount before lumbering out of the cage toward him. The tabaxi uses every ounce of his feline reflexes to flee headlong out the room, yelling to the previously chatty goblin guard to run for her life, the weapon has escaped!</p>\n        <p>The rest of the group is emerging from the goblin quarters to the bridge over the stream. Sildar was initially confused and hostile toward the seeming allies of the goblins, but Chappy and Nyoma healed and helped the man, and did their best to communicate silently to him that this was a rescue attempt. Yet as the four of them emerge onto the bridge, they encounter Bounty running as fast as he can the other way. \"The weapon is a living weapon and it's escaped and we need to leave NOW!\" Bount yells, with both the wolf and the creature hot on his heels behind. What comes next is absolute madness, with goblins from the chambers next to the weapon's screaming and fleeing in all directions, and the party trying to get everyone down from the bridge while holding off the wolf and the weapon, both intent on mauling anyone in their path. The weapon skewers Bount with a javelin and he falls unconscious, but is brought back to consciousness by Nyoma. Pandjet moves to protect the others, blocking off the far side of the bridge after Bount flees and Friendly jumps down to the lower level. Pandjet's steadfastness proves true, allowing him to hold the line despite suffering the sharp gnashing jaws of the wolf.</p>\n        <p>While Pandjet holds off the slavering canine, Chappy and Nyoma take up position on the bridge behind him. Finally, bleeding and bitten, the dragonborn leaps athletically down from the bridge, clearing the way for the two practitioners of the mystic arts. Nyoma launches bursts of destructive starstuff at the wolf and the weapon, while Chappy unleashes insults and barbs with words that carry the base vibrations of the fabric of reality, unmaking their foes from the inside out. The wolf is finally undone, and the great hairy beast pauses from the onslaught. Seizing the opportunity and newly conscious, Bounty catches the perfect angle and lets loose an arrow from below! The arrow flies fast and lodges itself between the beast's eyes, and with blood streaming down its face, it collapses into a wet muddy heap.</p>\n        <p>Friendly with her eight foot stature is able to help everyone still above down from the bridge. The group, now six with rescued hostage Sildar Hallweather in tow, is able to flee at pace out of the cave. They collect their wagon and horses, and safely hightail it away from the scene with the Cragmaw goblins still in total disarray from the violent chaotic scene just moments before.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 2) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Away from the confusion and disarray with the Cragmaw goblins, the wagon is back on the Triboar trial to Phandalin. Bounty of Nonsense, with his fine coat torn and soiled with blood, sits in the wagon along with Silder Hallwinter, badly beaten and with only threadbare clothing to his name. Friendly drives the wagon while Chappy shares the seat up front, and Nyoma and Pandjed parallel the cart on their horses. Sildar coughs a bit of blood into his fist and then, looking up, asks: \"What in the world happened back there?\" What ensues is a disjointed conversation of non-sequiters, partial explanations, and introductions. Silder and Bount greet each other, having known each other a bit back in Neverwinter, but unusually for the tabaxi, he is unable to carry much of a conversation as he is seriously shaken from the violence he just experienced.</p>\n        <p>Sildar explains he and Gundren set out from Neverwinter some days ago and made fine time, but were set upon by the goblins and ambushed. He does not know where Gundren was taken. Everyone else but Bount chips in to tell the story from their perspective, including the knowledge that Gundren seems to have been taken to Cragmaw Castle. Almost everyone expresses incredulity about the sophistication of the goblins, and Sildar is equally baffled, though Chappy remarks on tales she has heard about a sophisticated nation of goblinfolk far to the south.</p>\n        <p>Around dusk, the wagon pulls into the frontier town of Phandalin. It's a small town of log cabins and rough stone buildings, but even for its small size the town seems quite and still with a visceral sense of anticipation. Sildar refers the two groups to the Stonehill Inn near where they enter town from the north, and they stop the wagon there. Sildar heads on in, desperately needing rest and recovery. Friendly says she is going to visit her friend, the farmer Qelline Alderleaf, and see if she can lodge with Qelline and her wife. The rest enter the inn and make the acquaintance of Trilena and Toblen, the Innkeepers. Sildar and Bount take the two first-floor private rooms, and the rest of the group pays for beds in the shared upper-story loft. After a bit of grousing and retorts back and forth with Trilena, Chappy is exiled to a bed on a catwalk near the ceiling of the loft. But feelings are shortly smoothed over, and Chappy, Bounty, Nyoma, and Pandjed walk up the short flight of stairs to the common room of the Inn.</p>\n        <p>Friendly leads Buddy the cow across town to the Alderleaf farm, on the southeast edge of Phandalin. Friendly knocks, and Qelline shouts hesitantly from behind the door, \"Who's there?\" It seems quizzical, but after the firbolg introduces herself through the wood, Qelline throws the door open and embraces Friendly. They chat warmly, catching up. Friendly asks for a favor, that she might keep Buddy in the Alderleaf's barn. \"Because of all this trouble my people are having with the mining company, you see. I just want to make sure he's safe,\" she says. The halfling farmer readily agrees, but tells Friendly that there is at least some good news: the mining company has pulled up stakes and left town, due to the recent rumors and upset in the area. The only company representative still in town is young Halia Thornton, who used to be a low level clerk and now likes to style herself as the woman in charge. But, Qelline sadly notes, the real people in charge in the town right now are a group of young thugs known as the Redbrands. That gang is why Alderleaf was afraid to open the door, and they've been menacing the town for a while now. Friendly thanks her for the warning. Also, because Friendly mentioned her search for druidic allies as they caught up, Qelline asks Friendly for a favor in return. \"I've got a friend with those sorts of talents, he ventured up to the Thundertree ruins to check things out and I haven't seen him in a while. Could you check on him? He might be a good person for you to know anyway, his name is Reidoth.\" Friendly agrees and wishes Qelline a good night, before heading off back to the center of town.</p>\n        <p>Back at the Inn, the four wanderers have been chatting happily with Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is especially pleased to see Bounty of Nonsense again, wrapping him in a warm hug and referring to him as \"m'lord.\" They order drinks, and after a bit of enjoyable back and forth, Bounty inquires of Toblen, \"Say, friend. What is the story of that great boar head above the fireplace?\" The Innkeeper launches into a tale, not about himself but of the noted Falcon the Hunter from the nearby Neverwinter Woods. Falcon is quite the game hunter, but while tracking a particular elk one morning, he discovered he was being followed by a strange looking boar. Then, a few days later, he noticed either that same boar or another like it again. And it became a pattern, him feeling watched whenever he entered the depths of the forest to pursue his quarries. So Falcon, thinking that boars are intelligent and could \"get the message,\" set to hunt one. After days of cat and mouse he bagged his prey, and Falcon made a gift of the head to Toblen as a personal kindness. Appreciative of the story, Bount launches into one of his own in return. He tells an exaggerated version of their adventure with the weapon, and by the time he is done all of the smattering of villagers in the common room have their eyes on the tabaxi and his exotic looking comrades. When he reaches his climax there is scattered applause, and a few copper pieces wind their way to the group's table.</p>\n        <p>After ordering food, the four converse amongst themselves about the recent events and their plans for the future. When Toblen brings their meals, the characters again engage him in conversation. Chappy asks the Innkeeper more about Falcon, and about the woods he inhabits, noting a certain apprehension in Toblen's tone as he told his tale earlier. Mr. Stonehill does admit some trepidation about the woods, especially as folk have been disappearing there of late. The Wood was never the friendliest place, but people speak of deeper shadows and more threatening wildlife all the time. In fact, a group of woodworkers and loggers from Phandalin, including the brother of Elmar Barthen of the general store, headed deep into the woods to create a logger's camp. The very few communications returned from them speak of rising tension between the loggers, with some believing the camp to be \"cursed\" or the loggers to be otherwise doomed. In response to this news, the halfling pulls out her reporter's notebook and begins quizzing Toblin on the details. \"Well you know, it's important to get everything down for the Neverwinter Chronicle! … though don't necessarily expect to, uh, read about that any time soon. Mail from this far out is very unreliable, as you may have observed!\" Chappy also inquires about her Uncle Al Kalazorn, who the Innkeeper is familiar with. He has not seen Al in a bit, but also thinks that Elmar of Barthen's Provisions would be likely to know more.</p>\n        <p>While Chappy speaks to Toblen, Bount and Nyoma suddenly hear something odd: a birdlike caw outside that also simultaneously sounds like Bount saying his own name? Moving to investigate, they open the door to the inn and discover a crow outside – a crow cawing something remarkably similar to \"Bount!\" or \"Friendly!\" The bird is vexing, variably perching on Bount's shoulder or flying up into the rafter of the common room. Once again the group is attracting the wide-eyed attention of other patrons. Eventually an insight occurs to Nyoma and she whispers to the tabaxi, \"Do you think this... could BE Friendly?\" Shock is the general response, and Bounty heads with the bird outside. And indeed, the bird magically transforms back into Friendly! The tabaxi is slightly stunned, and Friendly informs him she only just learned how to do this particular trick: \"It's almost as if I've reached some arbitrary plateau of power!\" Bounty is distracted for a short while wondering if that's something HE could learn to do. Nyoma seems quite entertained by the entire business, as Bount tries to convince Friendly of the need for subtlety moving forward. After a while more conversation, the group retires for the night. The four head to their beds at the inn, while Friendly heads to the Alderleaf barn to sleep with Buddy.</p>\n        <p>During the night, Chappy is woken by strange sounds outside the window. Peering out, up in the sky she spots an impossibly large reptilian beast, extremely pale in color and luminous in the moonlight, flapping its creaking wings as it flies in circle over the town. Absolutely stunned, the halfling falls right out of the bed. This side wakes Nyoma, and she calls up, \"Chappy? Are you okay?\" Chappy whispers back, \"D-d-d-d-d-dragon!\" Nyoma makes a delighted and fascinated noise and runs to the window, but whatever was there now seems to be gone. Still, she believes the halfing, and tells her how much she would have liked to see a dragon. Chappy does not agree, being generally shaken by the sight. The two eventually return to bed.</p>\n        <p>The next morning, the individual characters split up on various errands of their own. Pandjed remains at the inn to manage his affairs. Bount heads to have his coat repaired, while Friendly spends the morning picking weeds before planning to meet up with the tabaxi. Chappy and Nyoma individually take in the town, but both end up converging on the town square around mid-morning. The halfling spots a small stone shrine to Tymora, the Goddess of Luck, currently being tended to by a dwarven woman on her hands and knees. Chappy walks up to ask her about her dwarven Uncle Al, surprising the woman in the process and causing her to quite clumsily bash her head on a shelf of the shrine. Getting up and dusting herself off, the woman introduces herself casually as Sister Graele, the keeper of the Shrine of Luck here in Phandalin. Chappy is a bit surprised at the lack of formality Graele displays. She asks the Sister about Al Kalazorn, and if she's heard anything. Graele, who seems quite absent-minded, thinks to herself and says, \"You know, to think of it, I haven't seen him in quite a while. Have you ever seen a hyena? Haven't seen one myself, but Big Al says they look like what a cat would look like if it were pretending to be a dog. They roam the plains far to the east, but not around here. Anyway, Al said he saw them around his property – them, and some larger creatures in the night he could never quite identify. I do hope he's alright.\"</p>\n        <p>Chappy frowns, and thanks Graele, and prepares to leave. But before she can, the Sister interjects, \"Oy there. You seem like a capable sort.\" She pauses. \"How do you feel about ghosts?\" It's an odd and disjointed turn, and Chappy says, \"Fair enough, I suppose?\" Graele explains that in her personal researches, she's learned of a \"ghost, or a spirit, or a banshee?\" who might have some information related to the location of a very old wizard named Bowgentle, which Graele would greatly like to find. \"I've got this comb and I think buttering old Agatha up would get the information out of her, but sad to say I made her quite angry last I visited.\" Graele asks Chappy if she would mind delivering the comb and trying to get the information out of the spirit? There is a path north from old abandoned Conyberry, a short ways into the forest and she's right there. Chappy, confused but always interested in a potential story, tentatively agrees to help and takes the comb.</p>\n        <p>Bount and Friendly meet up on the southeast end of town. As they talk, suddenly Friendly spots some young toughs wearing red cloaks sauntering down the dirt road – presumably the Redbrands. They decide to sneak after them. But as the redcloaks enter the town square, they happen to turn and spot the two outsiders before they can move out of the way. The young street toughs approach Bount and Friendly, and begin trying to accost them for money. Bounty attempts to bluff his way out with his signet ring, but the thuggish redcloaks are too ignorant to even know what it is supposed to be. The redbrands wave over a larger, meaner looking friend of theirs as he enters the square, and tensions rise. Nyoma spots the growing confrontation, and with a discrete wave of her fingers creates a hand of magical energy she carefully places right behind the half cloak of the meaner looking thug. He moves toward Friendly and Bounty threateningly seeking to physically take the demanded \"tax,\" and as he does so Nyoma's spectral hand intertwines itself with the folds of the cloak, and yanks the brute back. He stumbles back, trying to free himself from the cloak as it pulls and plays with him, and the other youths yell at him to stop playing about, referring to him as Jaren. At this confusion, Friendly steps forward and summons her mystical powers, creating a crackling green aura around the redbrands. Seeing this obvious display of magic, the gang begins shouting and cursing the characters as they fall back out of the square and begin running along the road out of town to the east. The group gives chase!</p>\n        <p>While they might have expected the thugs to escape to the Sleeping Giant taproom, which they had heard was a favorite location of the Redbrands, the gang continues running out of town and up some low hills to the burned out Tresendar Manor on the very eastern edge of Phandalin. Friendly transforms once more into a bird, but this time a hawk, and scouts out the manor. Completely destroyed and only exhibiting ruined walls and still-solid foundations, Friendly the hawk spots a set of stairs leading down into the earth, presumably into a cellar. The redcloaks are nowhere to be seen. The rest of the group proceeds to the Manor. Nyoma summons her deeper perceptions, and feels the tingle of a magical source somewhere below ground. \"That would be something worth protecting,\" she comments to the others.</p>\n        <p>As a group, they investigate the stairs. Slowly descending, they find themselves in a torchlit cellar storehouse, with a large deep cistern on one end of the room. There is a door near the entrance and also one near the cistern, and they are able to spot moving shadows in the room through the door next to the cistern. Nyoma once again reaches out to feel the call of power, and is able to feel that something of vague magical energy lies beyond the wall to the left of the cistern, strangely enough. The group carefully treads to the other end of the room, and begins setting about creating a display of force, so to speak. Chappy summons up illusionary magics to create an image of two flaming fist guards standing tall on either side of Bount, who positions himself in front of the door. On a count of three, Nyoma reaches out with the tendrils of her power and slams the door to the room with a resounding crack! Bounty commands, \"IN THE NAME OF THE FLAMING FIST PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!\" And at the same time, Friendly collects nature's power within herself and unleashes it as a thunderous wave of pressure right into the small room. The four redcloaks are indeed there, and one is knocked off his feet into the wall behind them. The remaining thugs seem terrified at the power being unleashed on them, but Jaran screams \"Fight them, boys! It's this or death!\" And the gang members lunge forward at the characters. A short bloody fight ensues, in which Nyoma tries again to command the youths to lay down their weapons, but they are too caught up in the rush of battle. By the end, Jaran is unconscious and Bount is once again bleeding through his coat, but the Redbrands have been put down with no actual deaths.</p>\n        <p>The party wakes one of the other three non-Jaran redcloaks, and interrogates him. Friendly intimidates him with a murderous-seeming fakeout involving death threats and a coin, but eventually the Redbrand member fesses up that this room is but the entrance to a larger secret complex underneath the manor which the Redbrands use as a hideout. He informs the characters the Redbrands are just local boys hired by a wizard named Glasstaff. The youth counts their number at around a dozen, not including the hobgoblins. \"Hobgoblins?\" Inquires almost everyone in the party simultaneously, to which the redcloak responds, \"Oh, yeah. The spider sent them to make sure we was doing what he wants, since I guess Glasstaff works for him.\" The characters share a look of surprise and intrigue at this, though Chappy seems inordinately happy about \"conspiracies\" and \"dark secrets.\" \"Think of the story this could be!\" she tells the group. The characters inquire about what this particular gang member has been up to, and he insists he has been mostly harmless, just exorting businesses for protection money. He does let slip that Jaren did kill that one wood worker, and they did end up kidnapping the woodworker's wife and daughter to be held here in the complex, but he insists that was Jaren and that everyone knows Jaren has a temper. After some haranging about morality and good decisions and making better choices by Nyoma, the group opts to let the three follower gang members leave after forcing them to promise to atone for their crimes by working for Sister Graele at the shrine. And also by leaving their coinage and valuables here to be collected by the party. The four unanimously agree to however leave Jaren tied up in the side room where the melee occurred. The follower ex-Redbrands beat it out of the cellar, but not before providing two more helpful bits of information: one, to watch out for the \"eye monster,\" and two, that the prisoners are near the old crypt, which is full of \"horrible old walking skeletons, like something out of a nightmare.\"</p>\n        <p>Exploring the wall to the left of the cistern, the party is able to discover a secret door leading to a long hallway passing off into unknown regions. Friendly transforms into a rat, and begins stalking forward down the twisting hall. The hall eventually opens up into a long, tall natural cavern with a chasm running longwise through it. As Friendly the rat studies the scene before her, an intrusive thought in her head suddenly adopts words as a rasping sentence is forced into her consciousness: \"Well, hello there interesting little creature. You are much too big for the tiny body you currently inhabit.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 3) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Confronted with the eerie rasping thought-sounds invading her inner mental narrative, Friendly responds with bald-faced lies. She insists to the voice that she IS a rat, and that the voice must be sorely mistaken. After a few moments of this back and forth, the voice goes silent. Friendly moves back to the rest of the group in the room with the cistern. Friendly the rat squeaks excitedly, prompting Bount to lean in and ask, \"Friendly, could that – be you?\" Chappy erupts in sudden annoyance, \"It's obviously her! Do we have to do this every time? Can we please be getting on with this?\" Not able to understand any of what Friendly tries to communicate about the room or the voice, the party prepares to move forward into the room with the narrow chasm. As they slowly creepy away from the finished stone toward winding natural rock walls and into the dark cavern, the rest of the group new begins to experience the unnerving static-y sensation at the back of their heads and necks that Friendly previously experienced. It is worst for Nyoma, who finds herself the next target of the voice. Audible only to her inside her head, it demands to know who they are and what they intend to do in this place. \"Guys!\" She yells out, \"I think someone here has a message spell? I've never experienced it before but I read about it once and this seems just like it! Are you using a message spell?\" She similarly stonewalls the voice, and eventually it says one final word before going completely silent: \"<b><i>Disrespectful.</i></b>\" After a few minutes, the unpleasant mental buzzing also stops affecting the four adventurers.</p>\n        <p>Gazing about the room, they see a long narrow room split by a chasm, with two narrow raw plank bridges spanning the pit. Two passages lead off to the west, into more finished stone walls and flagstone floors. A single winding natural stone passage twists off to the south. And the cavern seems to transition into a finished room of sorts off to the north, outside of the range of Nyoma's spell of light, centered on Chappy's pointed hat (due to the halfing not possessing the ability to see in dim or dark areas). They cross the southern bridge, which is no problem for Friendly the rat but collapses almost immediately under Nyoma's weight. She falls almost twenty feet and lands, bruised and slightly battered, but is able to climb back up the chasm with only minor difficulty and the assistance of a vine whip produced magically by Friendly, no longer shifted into the form of a rat. The group explores the southern tunnel, only to realize it extends for a long distance. Chappy muses, \"Wasn't there supposed to be a tavern they lurk around? Maybe this tunnel leads there?\" The group follows the tunnel a short distance, but returns on realizing it extends quite a long way. After some discussion, they decide to head down the more southern of the two western exists.</p>\n        <p>\"Well, I have been requested to attempt to be more brave,\" says Bount, pulling himself up to his full tall height. \"So I will, ah, do my best here.\" He gingerly pads forward quietly through the passage, once again encountering finished floors and walls and a staircase leading briefly down. On the lower level, the passage turns sharply to the right and there is a door on the left. Unlike the dark chasm room, this passage is lit by lanterns. The tabaxi pauses just before the turning of the passage, and cocks his hears to try and gauge far-off sounds. Off to the left, through the door, he hears a distant sound of something striking something else, like a stick against a bag of potatoes. Creeping back to the group, he tells them what he heard. \"Maybe this way whoever is in there is distracted, and we can keep going?\" Chappy retorts, \"Come on! What if someone is in danger in there and needs our help?\" Friendly: \"Yeah, buddy, sounds like somebody is in danger. We can just ignore that.\" After some back and forth, Bount is convinced. They formulate a plan, and take up position inside the cavern just outside the passage, ready to take action.</p>\n        <p>Nyoma summons up the power granted to her by Selune, and the ground in the passage – and in the rooms beyond – begins to shake and tremor as if in an earthquake! From the room there is the sound of shouting, and the door opens. A red-skinned hobgoblin in military-style chain mail emerges, wearing the livery of the Cragmaws, distracted and discombobulated by the shaking earth. Coming out the passage, he sees the adventurers, and is stopped for a moment in confusion. Bounty of Nonsense yells down the passage, \"Hail there! We were sent here by Clash!\" And suddenly the hobgoblin's look of confusion is replaced by one of cold fury, and he turns to the other occupants of the room: \"Beware, comrades! The outsiders have come to rescue the traitor goblin!\"</p>\n        <p>What follows is a protracted, bloody battle. The room proves to contain two mailed male hobgoblin soldiers bearing deadly sharp longswords, and a tall thin female hobgoblin in night-black leathers and wearing a lurid-red carved demon mask covering her entire face except for her mouth. The hobgoblins pour out of the room, taking cover behind the doorframe and the corner as the party takes cover around the exit of the passage. They trade ranged fire before the fight becomes a chaotic melee in the room with the chasm. The masked hobgoblin turns out to be lethally quick and strong with fists and punches threatening to break the party's bones. It is a frightening and difficult struggle, as the hobgoblins seem to have been militarily trained and pose the first real threat the adventurers have yet faced. But the party gives as good as it gets, trading blow for blow.</p>\n        <p>Throughout all this, Bount seems hesitant to commit to the violence and the bloodshed. As the battle continues and his comrades begin to seem exhausted and increasingly wounded, he is struck by a sudden idea. He steals away down the passage and into the left-most room, to see what was being hidden here. And in that room he discovers Clash, bound in a cage hung from the ceiling by a short metal chain. \"Why am I not surprised to see you again?\" She asks, with resignation in her voice. The tabaxi thinks quickly and makes her an offer: \"If I let you go, will you help us?\" After a moment's thought, the goblin responds, \"I don't think I have much of a choice.\" And after a quick application of lockpicking tools and expertise to the padlock holding the cage shut, Clash is free and on the ground. \"Here,\" Bount tells her as he hands her his dagger. She rushes out of the room, deadly serious about her task. Emerging from the passage just behind one of the hobgoblin soldiers, she efficiently sticks the dagger in his back between his ribs. \"That's what you get, you bastard.\"</p>\n        <p>With this turn of the tide, the fight begins to turn toward the adventurer's favor. But only then, something horrible happens. Suddenly, the eerie tingling back of the head feeling returns for everyone. And loping up out of the bottom of the chasm is an awful creature, hunched over and alternately walking bipedally and loping along on both hands and feet. Its body is elongated with wet moldy-red seeming skin, and most of its face is a single monstrously distended eye. In everyone's thoughts a sudden rasp intrudes: \"<b><i>Disrespectful creatures are made into meat.</i></b>\" This terrible thing corners Chappy against a wall, slicing at her with its claws and fixing it with baleful necromantic magics with bonechilling stares from its great piercing eye. Though by this point one of the hobgoblins has fallen, the masked \"monk\" has proved a more than suitable challenge. And she maneuvers herself behind the creature for cover, using her position to more easily strike at Chappy. But surprisingly, the monster does not take well to this, and snaps out at the masked hobgoblin in addition to the adventurers! The party makes the most of this and presses their advantage on the hobgoblin, eventually forcing her to retreat across the chasm and away. They let her go, being forced to simultaneously deal with the creature. After some time, its voiceless message erupts into Chappy's mind, \"<b><i>Submit to me.</i></b>\" Chappy surrenders, and the rest of the group follows shortly after. With the creature staring grimly at them, most of the party retreats to the room where Chappy was kept prisoner, with Bount leading the way. Friendly remains behind, intent on negotiating terms. \"So, what do you want, eh?\" \"<b><i>I must feed on magic. This body... I was... no matter. Any magic you find here, you must feed to me.</i></b>\" Friendly attempts to argue the monster down, but it budges not even a little. Finally, she agrees to its terms, tossing it a Shillelagh-enchancted piece of wood before following her companions in retreat.</p>\n        <p>With the entire group – plus Clash the goblin – secuestered away in the room with the door shut, everyone takes a moment to breath. But it's not long before someone asks, \"What in the world WAS that thing?\" Nyoma looks pensive for a moment before responding, \"I think it's called a Nothic. I don't know a lot about them, but I do know they feed on magical energies. Also, at least some of them started as people but were cursed to become like that? But I'm not sure if all of them are that way.\" Friendly then explains the terms of the deal she made with the Nothic. No one is entirely happy about it, but they are all happy to be away from the thing. Finally, Friendly turns toward Clash. \"So, what do we do about her?\"</p>\n        <p>Clash sits on one of the beds in the small room, fixedly staring at the floor. \"Don't you think you've already done enough?\" Bount tries to clam her down, \"Now, now. What do you mean? Don't you see what we've done for you here? We've freed you, that's a good thing.\" \"Are you kidding me?\" Clash seems unconvinced. \" You don’t actually have any idea what you've done, do you? You've ruined my life.\" Bount responds, \"Better that then them killing you! Why are you here, anyway?\" \"Because of you! You still got those traveling papers you forced me at swordpoint to write?\" Friendly grins and proudly holds them up: \"Right here!\" Clash: \"That's why, right there. You're the ones who killed me! Maybe they would have tortured me for a while, but there was at least a chance they would have let me go! Now if they ever see me again, they're definitely kill me. If I ever return to my homeland, they'll definitely kill me. You're just as bad as the hobgoblins,\" she moans wretchedly. Friendly is entirely unsympathetic to this, \"Mmm. Well, if you're going to say we're just as bad as them, maybe we should be. Maybe we should just kill you.\" Finally, Chappy steps in and interjects, \"Friendly, Bount, be quiet. Clash? You're right. We did play a role in how you got here, and I know that now because of what we did it looks to them that you're working with us. I'm sorry for that. It's awful to have something taken from you, some of us at least do know that. But maybe we can help. My uncle has a farm, or I'm sure there are goblins in Waterdeep...\" Friendly continues to argue and antagonize Clash, fully convinced she is a menace who would be better off dead. At one point Clash gets in Friendly's face, yelling and inviting the firbolg to end her life. But Chappy, Nyoma, and Bount defuse the situation. Eventually Bount negotiates a truce whereby Clash agrees to give them information, and in exchange, the party will try to fund her escape somewhere where she could be safe. At length, Clash reluctantly agrees.</p>\n        <p>As the group rests, Clash tells them what she knows of where they are. The individuals torturing her were part of the Iron Shadows, a special force within the Cragmaw Auxiliary responsible for rooting out treachery and engaging in spying. They were interrogating Clash on suspicion that she collaborated with the adventurers. Clash estimates that in this Redbrand hideout there were maybe a dozen redcloaks in addition to their leader, the wizard Glasstaff. But, she also comments quizzically, there is no way the battle earlier wouldn't have roused every single other person in the hideout with the shouts and the noise of the clash. Clash insists on waiting until they reach a more safe locale before providing any further information. \"After all, I'm not really convinced yet you're not just going to kill me.\"</p>\n        <p>After resting, the party sets off down the passage toward a second door just around the corner. Inside they find a sort of common room, filled with tapped kegs and a table with what looks to have been an interrupted dice game in progress with drinks, half-eaten food, and coin still on the table. Chairs in the room are strewn about as if the players left in a hurry. Friendly collects the coins from the table and distributes them around. Bount takes his share, places them in a small pack, and subtly tosses it over to Clash. She looks up at him and brusquely responds, \"Don't think I'm happy about this,\" but she takes the coins nonetheless.</p>\n        <p>The group continues to explore out of the common room toward the north, passing through a hallway on their way to a second door. Inside the door they find a well-stocked alchemical laboratory and library. Nyoma practically vibrates with delight at the collection of books, scrolls, documents, and knowledge available. Studying the alembics and vials and other distallation equipment on the table she announces, \"Looks like someone was trying to brew a potion of invisibility. No success yet, though, I think.\" The group then waits while she examines the books in the library. Most are tomes about alchemy and regional history, no different than anything she has seen before. But in particular, she comes across a book reprinting the journal of a dwarven roustabout named Urmon chronicling the history of the area around Phandalin. She eagerly dives in.</p>\n        <p>According to Urmon, more than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great mystical energy. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a device called the Forge of Spells, which it was said \"granted to its master a great and terrible power of magical creation.\" Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin prospered as well. But then disaster struck when the mine was attacked by individuals eager to seize the power of the Forge. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost. Also lost along with the cave was the fabled weapon Lightbringer, and enchanted hammer created to protect the Forge from malefactors.</p>\n        <p>Digesting and summarizing all of this information for the rest of the group, Nyoma eagerly admits, \"I have to tell you all something. This is why I'm here. This Forge, it's why I came to this area. Its effects have been felt from far away, and I've journeyed here to find this phenomenal artifact. I never expected to find anything about it down here, but well...\" Chappy responds with similar excitement, \"Wow! That sounds amazing. That could be like, not just an article but a whole book! Would you possibly be willing to sign a contract of exclusivity here? I mean, we can talk about that later, but it sounds fascinating in any case.\" \"Indeed,\" echoes Bount, \"but we should probably finish exploring here.\" The group moves beyond another door to another room to the east of the lab, after spending a moment to try and ensure they hear no noises beyond the door.</p>\n        <p>The room they enter seems to be some kind of bedroom, with plush red drapes covering the walls. A comfortable bed sits in the room with a closed chest at its foot, and there is a nicely-detailed writing desk covered in paper and ink. And at one spot in the wall, the drapes are shifted aside to reveal a portion of the wall having been left ajar. A secret door! But before proceeding, Nyoma and Bount open the chest and look inside. They find exquisite women's clothing, suitable for traveling, several piles of coins and gems, a scroll case containing a magical scroll, and a strange-looking round featureless wooden mask, also clearly (to the tiefling) mystically enchanted. Nyoma also examines the writing desk. There she finds two items of importance – a letter to a \"Lord Albrek\" from an individual signing the letter with the sigil of a spider, and a small shiny black stone pyramid inscribed with an odd incoherent mix of celestial and infernal sigils. The party discusses the contents of the letter and the small object, which Nyoma assumes must be the key discussed.</p>\n        <img src=\"./images/session_3_letter.png\" className=\"session-img img-shadow\" alt=\"Session 3 Letter\" />\n        <p>They then move on, exploring the rest of the hideout complex. In one of the last areas to be explored, they find the family crypt of the Tresendar Manor, with sarcophagi complete with images of the occupants from life carved into the lids. Already plundered is the crypt of Aldith Tresendar, patron of the family and they presume the source from which the key was found. Everyone except Bount wants to investigate the other crypts for valuables or other import items. \"Hold on, hold on everyone,\" Bount says, pausing the activity. \"I know we've been forced to do some difficult things today, but disturbing the rest of this family? This woman and her two daughters? Doesn't that seem cruel and cold?\" He does his best to convince them not to exume these tombs, but in the end the best he can do is to get them to agree to look and only take objects if they are strictly relevant to what seems to be going on. The tabaxi excuses himself while the others look, finding nothing.</p>\n        <p>Proceeding onward, the group happens on one last noteworthy encounter: the remaining members of the Dendrar family, locked in cells just off the crypt! There is a moment of confusion due to Bount wearing a Redbrand cloak, but it is cleared up when they explain they are here to save the Dendrars. The mother and two Dendrar children thank them profusely, and after a moment raiding the discovered armory of the redcloaks, the adventurers lead the Dendrars out of the hideout (making sure to stay far away from the room with the chasm and the creature they have taken to calling Timothy) back toward town to safety. Before the Dendrars leave the group, the mother Mirna informs them, \"I don't have any valuables to pay you with. But my family lived in Thundertree when I was a girl, before the walking dead claimed the town. My mother owned an herb and alchemy shop, and kept an emerald necklace in a case under the storage shelves. If you're ever down that way and locate the necklace, please keep it with my thanks.\" The Dendrars then make their own way back into town. The group stops for a moment and debates where to take Clash, eventually deciding on Bount's private room at the Inn. Bount brings out his disguise kit to do his best to make it slightly less obvious that Clash is a goblin, and the now five individuals reenter Phandalin, doing their best not to draw attention in the growing evening.</p>        \n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 4) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>The five – Nyoma Izarren, Chappy Quickstep, Bounty of Nonsense, Friendly, and the goblin clash – stand on a hillside on the edge of town as the sun sets. Having just let the Redcloak's hideout under Tresendar Manor, their aim is to move Clash to Bount's private room at the Stonehill Inn without the goblin being seen by any townsfolk. The group huddles together, and the hatch a plan which they quickly put into action. Leaning down, Bount pulls out his disguise kit and calls Clash over. He does his best to make over the goblin to resemble a human, though the end effect is one that is undoubtedly better when viewed at a distance. \"Hey Chappy,\" Bount calls over to the halfing, \"can I borrow your hooded robe very briefly?\" After adjusting the hood around Clash's face, he announces \"Ok, there you go. But, um, maybe try and mostly look down as we head into down?\" Clash grins mirthlessly and groans, \"Sure. Whatever you need.\"  </p>\n        <p>Entering the village, Nyoma reaches out her hand with fingers outstretched, closing her fist as the lights on the path to the Inn dim, reducing visibility. Bount tries to stealthily cover Clash on the narrow dirt paths as they sneak along. But they are accosted by a merchant: \"Ho there, traveler! Might you be interested in purchasing some garlic? I've got all kinds, including some for medicinal purposes. Forgive me for saying, but your child looks a bit ill!\" This is where Nyoma intercedes, showing an extreme amount of interest in the merchant's wares and everything they might be able to be used for. \"Would you possibly have any black garlic? I love it, it's such a delicacy!\" And as the merchant digs around in his pouch to produce some for the tiefling, Clash and Bount are able to sidle on around and ahead.  </p>\n        <p>Finally, they just have to get around the village square to reach the Inn. \"I've got an idea,\" Chappy informs the others, and she jogs ahead to the middle of the square. Grabbing her lute, she proceeds to begin loudly playing a ballad titled \"The Green Halfling.\" In it, she sings about the rainbow of colors that a halfling can be born with, and that before one judges too quickly, maybe you should think twice or even thrice. The initial crowd response trends negative, but the bard manages to feel the air of the crowd and using her halfling ingenuity, lands a couple of jokes in time with comments from the crowd and manages to win them over. As the crowd gathers, Bount and Nyoma are able to escort Clash through a back door into the Inn without further attention. Seeing them go, Chappy abruptly announces the end of her show and leaves the crowd most definitely wanting more.  </p>\n        <p>With the entire party stuffed inside Bounty of Nonsense's private room, everyone has a chance to relax and breath for the first time in a while. Nyoma steps out to speak with Toblen Stonehill to order dinner for the group, and when she returns she says, \"So, what now? What is our plan here?\"</p>\n        <p>The group first considers what to do to help Clash. Chappy suggests they find her uncle, Big Al Kalazorn, and that he could offer Clash employment as a shipment guard and a route to Neverwinter. Bount lets Clash know they want to do what they can to help her. Clash for her part apologizes for her bitterness and lets the group know that she sees that everything they've done they have done for good reasons, and that she appreciates the efforts they are going to in order to help her now. Bout in turn asks Clash want she wants. Clash admits that she liked her previous life, that she put on a uniform to help people and because following orders comes easy to her. But she signed up to help people in her country, her empire, not to travel a thousand miles and muck about in the lives of people far away. She says she realizes now the Cragmaw aren't as justified or righteous as she once thought. And she would like to find a way to make her own decisions. The group agrees to help her do that. Chappy initially posits a plan where they leave first thing tomorrow, before the sun rises, but Clash asks them to hold off because the Cragmaw or the Black Spider may be looking for her. They agree to lay low for a while.</p>\n        <p>Next, the conversation turns to the Forge of Spells. Nyoma speaks passionately about the need to investigate it and ensure it is taken care of. Bount seems worried about what the Forge could be and about the consequences of this plan, and Clash agrees, noting that often things that are so important are also very dangerous. It takes a fair bit of convincing for Nyoma and also Chappy to convince Bount they have something approaching an obligation to see that the Forge does not fall into the wrong hands. </p>\n        <p>As one final note before the group breaks up, Bount looks over at Chappy and says, \"Hey, would you have any idea where I could get a document or something with Townmaster Wester's signature on it?\" The halfling fixes Bount with a look of extreme skepticism, and narrowing her eyes she says, \"What are you up to here?\" \"Oh, nothing, nothing at all! You know me!\" Responds Bounty, quickly changing the subject. </p>\n        <p>Bount and Clash remain in the room, planning to bed down for the night. Both Nyoma and Chappy excuse themselves. Nyoma leaves the inn, but Chappy moves to the Inn's common room. It is loud and boisterous tonight, with a colorful crowd (literally) shouting over cards. She gets a drink and pulls out a magical tome she had left over from Bard College. She begins studying a spell for the rapid heating of metal, reading it over and over until she feels the mental exhaustion coming over her. Finishing a second ale and reading a single paragraph for the tenth time in the loud common room, she thinks to herself, \"Wow! This really is just like the College.\" She then puts up the spellbook and ambles over to the card table. </p>\n        <p>While Chappy is studying, Nyoma has found herself a quiet open place in the field behind the Inn. Locating a small tumbled Wall, the tiefling settles down beside it and takes up a meditative position. She reflects on the events of the past few days, internally narrating her journey and the people and things she has encountered. She is delivering this story to Selune, reporting on her progress and the things that she has seen to her patron goddess. Perhaps Nyoma considers how different her life has been since leaving Candlekeep, how she never quite imagined the outside world would be like this. Throughout all of this, though, she acquires a feeling of peace and tranquility. She looks forward to the full moon two more nights hence, when Selune's power in the world will wax. But as she is winding down her meditation and preparing to leave, Nyoma is suddenly startled out of her reverie by a sudden chill wind creaking out of the east. She finds herself covered in a strangely localized dusting of snow, carried by the wind but seemingly existing nowhere else. This is highly unusual, given the early fall (or even late summer) time of the year currently.</p>\n        <p>Meanwhile, Chappy is playing cards with a group consisting of an exceptionally tall wood elf with a drawling accent who has introduced himself as Gazzenar or simply Gazz, and his identical twin water genasi companions Pax and Drax. As they play Three Dragon Ante and Chappy slowly accrues sizable winning, Gazz reveals that he has heard of the halfling bard and her companions. \"There was something about a pet raven? Or crow? Some kind of bird, surely. You must be adventures, do tell me your tales!\" But Chappy feels there is something not quite right about this group, and both hems and haws when it comes to herself and plays up her own drunkenness. The wood elf continues to go on, explaining that he and his companions are also adventurers, and have found themselves in the perhaps unenviable position of being dragon hunters of late. Before Chappy excuses herself from the table with a tidy sum in hand, Gazzenar makes sure to inform her: \"Now mind, if you do happen to come upon the location of any dragon dens or nests or other locations of habitation, we would pay good coin for such information. Do let us know!\" </p>\n        <p>The next morning, the party (minus Friendly and Pandjed) are enjoying a breakfast of herring and ham in Bount's room with Clash. After Nyoma brings the food, Chappy insists on paying and mentions her surprise windfall at the table last night. \"Also, the money was won from some people who were suspicious as hell.\" Bount: \"Don't you think you're burying the lede there? What people?\" Chappy explains, including about them being dragon hunters. Much like with the Forge of Spells, Bount seems shocked and incredulous at the idea of there actually being any dragons about. \"Well, uh, I actually saw one,\" Chappy admits. \"Isn't it EXCITING?\" Nyoma exclaims. Bount once again stops the conversation: \"Talk about burying the lede twice in a row, Chappy! When in the world did you see a dragon?\" The halfling finally explains what she saw and shared with Nyoma the night it happened. While Nyoma continues to seem fascinated by the possibility of dragons, Bount and Chappy are noticably less enthused. Together they agree to be less \"dragon hunters,\" and more \"dragon watchers,\" or even more passively, \"dragon noticers.\"</p>\n        <p>The three head out for the day, leaving Clash behind to hide out in the room. They together head to the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company able to supply them with traveling gear and personal arms for Clash and for themselves. After that, they had to drop in on Sildar. He continues to be recuperating in bed, covered with bandages and with a split pinning one of his arms. Hallwinter is quite pleased to see them, warmly greeting them and imploring Bount if he has any additional information on Gundren or his location. But first Nyoma on seeing Sildar's condition, reaches out and uses her power to speed his healing along. The human mercenary is vocally grateful for the tiefling's ministrations. To Hallwinter's initial question, Bount replies that they do, but that while they are going to get the dwarf – that they are definitely on a path that so to speak eventually leads to the dwarf – there is someone else they must help first. Sildar seems concerned about this, but the group assuages him that this other person also dearly needs help and that they will rescue Rockseeker. \"But can I ask,\" Bount inquires, \"How is Gundren's mettle? Will he last?\" Sildar assures them that the dwarf is as tough as brass tacks and that he will last come hell or high water. They then speak for a while, with Hallwinter giving his opinion on the best methods for overcoming Cragmaw Castle and rescuing the dwarf, finishing up with, \"and frankly, the easiest route might be if you could get someone on the inside, who could help you bypass the security.\" For just a moment the tabaxi gets a glint of inspiration in his eye before Chappy cuts him off with a highly icy, \"No, Bount. Whatever you're thinking, don't.\" Eventually the group bid their farewells to Sildar and begin leaving. But before they can get out the door, the mercenary forces a pouch of gold coins into their hands as thanks for saving his life. He then thanks them and wishes them well in their upcoming journey.  </p>\n        <p>Toward dinner time, the group once again waits for a meal to be brought to them in Bounty's room. They discuss the possibility of having Chappy once more act as a patsy at the card table to learn more about the suspicious dragon hunters, when someone knocks on the door. Outside is Trilena Stonehill, with a tray of meals in hand. But before she hands them over, she hesitantly informs the group, \"Um, I'm sorry for the bother. But there is some kind of important looking woman out in the village square. She has asked for everyone to head out there for some kind of announcement 'of grave importance?'\" Looks of concern and dread cross the faces of all those in the room.</p>\n        <p>Nyoma, Chappy, and Bount head outside to the square, making sure to stay to the edges of the crowd. In the middle, elevated on a hastily placed wooden crate, is a prim and proper woman with long blonde hair pulled back, wearing exquisitely-trimmed red robes. Nyoma gasps and points at the woman's hand: \"A glass staff!\" And indeed, it is a long staff topped by a vaguely luminiescent glass sphere. The woman occasionally leans down and speaks to some tough-looking local youths, types who are not currently wearing red cloaks but one might not be surprised if they had been a day or two ago.  </p>\n        <p>She begins speaking: \"Good towns folk, some of you may know me and others may not. My name is Iarno Albrek, and I am a wizard and a member of the Lord's Alliance, representing the major powers of the Sword Coast. I have unfortunate and frightening news to bring to you tonight. There are goblins in our midst!\" The crowd erupts in murmers and isolated shouts of fear and anger. \"They are hiding somewhere in this town, laying the groundwork for their comrades to invade this village and lay waste to everything you have created.\" The volume increases as the tension in the crowd ratchets up. \"But we will not let them do this! We are going to be organizing search parties. We will search house by house, until these horrible monsters are uncovered and we can secure our safety once more!\" At this point a true panic has set in, and at that moment the three take the opportunity to scurry away back to Bount's room in the Inn.</p>\n        <p>Speaking in hushed tones even in the privacy of the room, the three express confusion and fear over what is happening. Shortly, Pandjet and Friendly join them. \"Iarno Albrek... that's Glasstaff. That's the leader of the Redbrands. She's working for the Black Spider,\" muses Nyoma, connecting the dots. \"She was the woman the letter from the Spider was addressed to, and she also had the Forge key.\" Chappy says, \"And now she's coming for us.\" Plans are hurriedly made, until they can hear a commotion outside the door down the hall. It sounds like Trilena, stridenly yelling, \"I'm not sure if I can allow you to search the rooms of my guests!\" Bount stands up: \"It's time to go.\"</p>\n        <p>The three, along with Clash, sneak out of the Inn room window onto the grassy field outside the inn. Search parties with lanterns led by young toughs are walking up and down the paths on the other sides of the building. \"Hold on,\" Nyoma instructs the others. She sneaks off to the stable on the north side of the inn, and as quietly as possible she begins freeing the horses and preparing them to travel. But just as she is leading them out, one is spooked and whinnies. Outside Nyoma hears a voice, \"Hey! I just heard something inside the stable! Let's go!\"  </p>\n        <p>Running now, the tiefling leads the horses outside and begins organizing her companions onto the horses. \"Clash, you should be with me on my horse. Bount, Pandjed, and Chappy, I think you're going to have to share one too unfortunately.\" Bount responds, \"Don't worry about me, I can handle myself here.\" Nyoma rejoins with, \"You're going to keep up with horses? Are you serious? We have to leave!\" But Bounty calmly assures her he's got this. And off they go.  </p>\n        <p>The party engages in a cat and mouse game (albeit one with the cat in the role of the mouse), dodging torch-bearing search parties between houses. The tabaxi proves more than capable of keeping up with the horses in the dark and treacherous night ride, variably running on two legs and occasionally dropping to sprint on all fours. Eventually they are noticed the groups led by the youths as well as Albrek begin to follow, but by this time the group is in a field leading to a northeastern gap and on into the wilds around Phandalin. Fleeing on the horses, Nyoma is in the lead. She and Clash leap over a short rock wall, and are suddenly surprised by an outlying search party of villagers absent any of the young toughs leading the more aggressive groups. The villagers, spotting a hastily made up Clash and Nyoma, suddenly pause. They were ready to search, but upon being surprised by a pair on horseback in the dark, they are not so sure of what to do on reaching the finding part of the exercise. Thinking fast and making the most of the hesitation, Nyoma spurs her horse onward and they thunder off down a hill and away from the village toward escape, with the rest of the party not far behind. </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 5) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Nyoma, Bount, Chappy, and Clash sit under the stars in a clearing several miles out of Phandalin. It is the middle of the night, and they just evaded the search parties hunting for the goblin. They plot where to head next, eventually deciding to indeed try for Uncle Big Al Kalazorn's farmstead as a possible route to safety for Clash. \"Though I should say, Uncle Al's maybe... not the biggest fan of goblins? You know how dwarves are,\" she says, looking hesitant. Clash looks slightly alarmed, prompting Bount to reply, \"Hey, you know, people can change. Look at... well, probably all of us.\" Bedding down for the night, it is chilly and the party is left without much warm traveling gear. There is some back-and-forth between Chappy and Bount, with Chappy remarking about how nice it must be to have a fur coat, prompting Bount to retort, \"Just don't skin the tabaxi, okay?\" Chappy is of course horrified at this suggestion.</p>\n        <p>During the night's watch, Nyoma once again settles into meditation and communing with Selune. She reports on everything she has seen and experienced so far, with her search for Iarno Albrek and having learned Albrek is apparently in the service of the Black Spider. The meditation causes an unexpected feeling of warmth to suffuse throughout her being, and she is at peace while communing. It is but one more night until the full moon, when Selune's power in the world is maximized. The tiefling feels electric at the prospect.</p>\n        <p>The group spends the next day traveling over fields parallel to the road, heading to the west toward Conyberry and Big Al's land. During the day, they encounter a worn ancient-seeming stone marker. Probably used in the past to indicate directions and place names, the glyphs carved into the stone are far too worn to be read. But they seem to refer to the east-west Triboar trail the group currently parallels, as well as a beaten-down ghostly remnant of a path heading south up into the foothills of the Sword mountains. The rest of the day is uneventful. </p>\n        <p>It is the night watch, there in the remote fields and copses of trees, where the day's main events occur. Chappy taking first watch, continually has the eerie feeling of being watched. After the turns the watch over to Nyoma, the tiefling devotee of Selune prepares for an involved personal ritual, to commune even more closely with her diety. As she engages in the internal rhythms and motions, reflecting on her experiences so far, she is startled awake to realize the moon hangs low in the sky. Not just hanging low in the sky, see sees the moon descend bodily further and further, until its shining bright immensity almost fills the edges of her vision. The white-yellow full moon hangs so close to the earth she could almost touch it. As she studies this, Nyoma is alarmed to realize the edges of the moon are slowly being swallowed by shadow. The darkness swallows more and more of the moon, until only a pinprick is left shining through. \"Please, please, I don't... understand. I don't know what this means,\" Nyoma pleads internally with the opaque rules governing this vision. And with this pleading, the tiefling hears a simple phrase intoned in her ears: \"Hunger seeks power, regardless of intent.\" At this, the pinprick of light explodes outwards, blinding her momentarily. When she recovers, the moon is once more high in the sky where it should be, and the vision is over. But at her feet is a tome, a Book of Shadows containing new powers and secrets of her celestial patron.</p>\n        <p>Nyoma does not mention any of this to Bount as he takes the third watch, but the tabaxi has an unnerving experience of his own. After two or three hours, just as things are becoming perfectly monotonous, Bounty of Nonsense hears a strange, eerie cry from in the wood surrounding their camp. It is halfway between an animal yowl and a vaguely humanoid-sounding cry: \"Help!\" Bount cries out in response, \"Hello?\" The voice or noise or whatever it might be sounds again, slightly closer. Once again, but more anxiously this time from Bount: \"Hello? Is anyone there and do you need help?\" One more time, the voice-noise. Bount now debates with himself, to charge off and be brave or to be cautious and hold off. In the end, the tabaxi leans toward caution and also skepticism, and remains in camp. The voice-noise is not heard again. </p>\n        <p>In the morning, over breakfast the group discusses all that happened during the night with concern and trepidation. Bount is alarmed by Nyoma's vision, while the tiefling is chiefly excited in response, but also curious about the meaning of the curious sight and the whispered phrase. Nyoma also explains some of the tantalizing new rituals and spells contained in the tome granted her by Selune. One spell in particular includes the ability to identify a magical item. Excitedly trying this on the mask the group found in Iarno Albrek's things, she is finally able to put a name to the object: The Mask Within. The Mask allows the user to detect the thoughts of others, or to detect their presence from thoughts if unseen. Due to her particular history, the use of this magical artifact disquiets Nyoma significant, and neither of her companions seem exactly comfortable with it either. Eventually Nyoma grudgingly agrees to take it, not entirely sure how she feels about that. The warlock also takes a break from the rest of the group for a while shortly after this. She returns to everyone holding an owl, who she explains is her new companion and whose name is... Kevin.</p>\n        <p>After breakfast, the party decamps and begin's the day's hike. Yet a very curious thing occurs: the day – or at least the sun – never actually quite comes. As time proceeds, the group realizes it never gets any lighter than twlight, and thick clouds cover the entire sky. It produces an ominous atmosphere.</p>\n        <p>Toward mid-afternoon, the party approaches the outskirts of the abandoned town of Conyberry. They converse for a moment about how none of them know exactly why or when Conyberry was abandoned, simply that it's known as a local landmark for being abandoned. They decide to proceed down the Triboar trail through the middle of the ruined settlement. But on entering the outskirts, they realize the abandoned town is not at all ordinary. The road, buildings, and even the earth as they proceed have all been turned into some kind of strange glass-like substance. Nyoma examines the glass and declares this was the product of magic, but of what kind of magic she is unsure. In spots the glass substance has been stained with mysterious oily black viscous material.</p>\n        <p>Continuing on, the group crosses a stream, and climbing up the other bank they are suddenly set upon by loping, leering, cackling hyena creatures! Gnolls, Nyoma identifies them, hunched over vaguely humanoid parodies of hyenas with exposed brain matter and muscle tissue, drooling the oily viscous black sludge spotted earlier. The foursome leaps into combat, as more and more waves of the demonic hyena creatures fall upon them. After a tense pitched battle they overwhelm their foes, and opt to retreat across the stream and circle around Conyberry before possibly more of those creatures can appear.</p>\n        <p>They find no more monstrous creaturesm passing north of Conyberry and into the edges of the massive and foreboding Neverwinter Wood. They do cross a trail heading from Conyberry further north into the Wood. Chappy looks north along the trail and muses, \"I wonder if this leads to Agatha's cottage.\" After a moment of reflection, the group continues on.</p>\n        <p>The twilight descends into night, and the party hikes on, close to Big Al's. After two hours of full darkness, they approach the cornfields surrounding the farmstead. Passing across an open pasture to the east of the farmhouse, they are startled to realize a hastily constructed barrier wall spans the grounds immediately surrounding the farmhouse. Investigating, they make contact with Alphone Kalazorn himself on the other side of the wall peering down at them: \"Little niece, is what you? What in the world are you doing out here, in all this horrible mess?\" He helps them up and over, and he embraces Chappy warmly but it is obvious he is haggard and worn down. One of his farmhands, a woman named Nessil, looks over the wall at the two horses the group left behind. She darkly comments, \"You know, it's been a while since our meat ran out...\" But she trails off and leaves before anyone can follow up. With no further explanation, Big Al leads them up to the farmhouse. </p>\n        <p>In the two-story farmhouse, the group discovers over half a dozen families cramped inside, and all eyes are on them as they enter. Big Al leads them to the kitchen where they catch up briefly. Chappy introduces her friends and explains she has come to help, not having heard from Uncle Al in ages. Big Al realizes Chappy is falling into the familiar life of an adventurer, and his eyes swell with pride. With time and some reluctance, Alphonse explains what happened here. They first spotted the hyena creatures several months ago, but over the weeks they got more violent and more destructive and more numerous. Several weeks ago they began attacking other farmsteads in this rural sparsely populated region, and Alphonse having been an adventurer, began gathering families for common defense at his farmstead. Maybe ten days ago, the day stopped coming, and during the darkest night the gnolls now test the walls. \"I'm worried about our ability to hold out, with our supplies so low. We might have been better off if that wizard and his furtive-seeming companion at Old Owl Well had accepted my request for them to join us and provide assistance, but seemingly their obscure arcane researches kept them too busy. I hope they are still alive, at least.\" Their conversation is briefly interrupted by an old busybody local, deeply suspicious of the newcomers and concerned for the remaining supplies at an almost paranoid level. Bount is able to quell her by flagrantly displaying his signet ring. They are granted peace for the moment as she retreats back upstairs, though Big Al intimates that she is not without her followers here, unfortunately.</p>\n        <p>Overnight, the group volunteers to help the locals patrol the walls. It turns out to be an extremely jarring experience, as the creatures outside scratch and bang at the walls intermittently, seemingly randomly producing bangs at locations both close and far from each other.</p>\n        <p>Chappy takes first watch. After she is out there a while, Big Al comes to speak with her. He seems very concerned about her and the dangerous path she is setting down, but Chappy assures him she will be fine. Big Al informs the halfing something she was not aware of, that her Aunt Lisa was very taken with her, and paid significant attention to stories about Chappy from Chappy's mom. \"She saw something of herself in you, something about your not quite fitting in but driving to find a place for yourself.\" Chappy is surprised but gratified. At length and with some awkwardness, Uncle Al tells Chappy she should speak more with Sister Graele back at Phandalin. \"She was a close friend and companion of your Aunt, and she knows this life. If you're going to do this, you need support. Maybe just think about.\" Chappy gives Uncle Al a long hug, and then sends him back to the farmhouse so she can continue her watch.</p>\n        <p>Nyoma takes next watch, and carefully uses Kevin to patrol the surrounding pasture and cornfields to watch for the creatures. They hide in the corn and only appear as rustling stalks here and there, but they seem to be systematically testing the walls, moving in groups to strike at possible weak points throughout the night. During Bount's watch, for which Clash comes along, something altogether stranger occurs. Several times Bount and Clash hear the voice of Nyoma out in the corn: \"Bount, help! I need help! I am all alone here!\" Bount tests the voice three times: asking who is with her, asking about their past together, and asking her just to state his full name. Each time the voice, pitch perfect as Nyoma's voice, simply repeats: \"I am alone. Please help! I need help.\" Bount and Clash debate, but again decide not to pursue. Eventually the voice stops, and both the tabaxi and the goblin are left disquieted. \"I don't know if that was the right thing to do,\" Bount says, pausing. \"Hey, Clash. I honestly don't know if we are going to get out of all this. If something happens to me out here, would you promise me that you'll see to it I get some kind of headstone? Something to remember me by?\" Clash smiles grimly and responds, \"Don't worry, friend. I'll get you the nicest scrap wood headstone planted right above a fresh earth gravestone beside an outside ever seen. Don’t you worry at all.\"</p>\n        <p>In the morning, the group resolves to head to Old Owl Well, to seek help from the wizard and other fellow there and to see if they have any answers here. There is more than a little suspicion about the pair, and in fact Chappy suggests that possibly these two are in fact the cause of the demonic spillover into the material plane. While Chappy and Bount debate this, Nyoma pulls Big Al aside and suggests a plan during the light parts of the day to cull portions of the corn. \"It would mean less cover for the gnolls to attack your walls.\" Alphonse thinks it's a capital idea, and agrees to get people on it right away. Shortly after breakfast, Bount, Chappy, and Nyoma depart for Old Owl Well. Clash for her part, disguised as a halfling, decides to remain behind for safety sake, feeling her inability to keep up with the others during the fight with the hyena-things in the Conyberry outskirts.</p>\n        <p>The group heads south into the foothills, until they see a low mound topped with a crumbled old watchtower and a partially remaining tumbledown barrier wall. The three sneak up the hill, where they spot a tall fancy red tent pitched beside the tower, of which the first floor is still intact. Spotting some figures wandering about inside the tower, Bount sneaks up to get a better look. As he approaches the wall itself, he sees that the figures rummaging around inside the tower are animated skeletons, nearly a dozen or so! But he also slips on the gravel of the hillside, alerting the undead to his presence. They slowly shuffle outside of the building toward Bount, until Chappy, thinking quickly, magically invokes a minor illusion of the tabaxi on the other edge of the ring, positioned just over a small cliff. The skeletons take the bait and shuffle after the illusion, with eventually the first few throwing themselves off the small cliff and becoming pulverized at the bottom.</p>\n        <p>At this noise, the two men in the tent emerge. One is short and pudgy, clad in a bespoke red robe, bald and with a tattoo on his forehead. The other is a tall thin man in subtle black leathers. \"My skeletons!\" Wails the bald man in a high tremulous whine. Bount remains hidden, but Chappy and Nyoma approach forth. The pair of men introduce themselves as Hamun the Red, wizard and official member of the Magical Bureau of Thay, and his companion Nine-Fingers Jasper. Nyoma and Chappy converse with the two for a long while, finding Hamun garrulous and willing to share, but he is continually shut up by the slightly sinister and altogether too suave Jasper, who insists on not providing information without getting something in return. Bounty of Nonsense keeps himself hidden, and in fact begins maneuvering around the hillside stealthily to the back of the pair's tent. </p>\n        <p>Hamun the Red and Nine-Fingers Jasper seem entirely unconcerned both with the locals, Big Al's farmstead, and in fact even the sun having seemingly disappeared, in favor of their own personal researches into a very ancient object located in Conyberry. They both display a kind of casually blasé reaction to the idea of innocent lives being in danger. Jasper offers to help the locals in exchange for some assistance with a quick trip into Conyberry for their work. But Chappy and Nyoma beg off, pleading that they have too many things to do. Yet they do keep the pair busy while Bounty of Nonsense slips silently into their tent. The tabaxi rogue examines the cluttered interior, packed with magical equipment, books, maps, notes, and various objects and random things. He fills his arms with the most intriguing things he spots: a map scribbled over with comments, a book, a scrollcase, and a medium-sized lockbox. Then, again as quietly as he possibly can, he books it out of the tent and down the hill. Somehow, possibly as a combination of his skill at stealth and the tent's occupants being distracted in conversation, he gets away entirely unnoticed! Seeing him run down the hill, Nyoma and Chappy quickly end their conversation with the pair and bid them farewall, none too warmly. As they are well and truly away from the hill, they hear just on the edge of their hearing a truly raucous hue and cry from the camp. They hurry into the distance, off and away.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 6) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Nyoma, Chappy, Bounty of Nonsense, and Clash take shelter in a deep cleft between two looming foothills several miles away from the camp of Hamun Kost the Red and Nine-Fingers Jasper. Taking a moment to breath after fleeing from the tent, Bount turns to the other two: \"So, those guys... were they cool?\" Nyoma stares at him and pauses before responding, \"No, Bount. They were definitely not cool. I mean, Hamun wanted to talk I guess, but his friend very clear would not let him.  His friend was kind of threatening, honestly.\" Bount: \"Huh. Oh, well. At least we have this stuff to go through!\"</p>\n        <p>The three examine the objects the tabaxi lifted from the tent. They include a journal-plus-spellbook and a scroll case, which Nyoma latches on to, the small ornate lockbox, with Bount takes, and a large map of the region with hand-drawn annotations in red ink, which Chappy studies. Nyoma finds written incantations that she deems useful for herself, while Bount carefully picks the box's lock. Inside they find some mysterious liquids in vials – potions! - and an intricately beautiful, ancient shiny metal ring. The tabaxi pops the ring onto his finger, and he is able to feel the power sparking off the ring even without knowing more.</p>\n        <p>Poring over the map, Chappy speaks up, \"Hey, look here – it says, 'door, substantial ichor.' Something tells me that's where we should be heading next.\" The attention of the group is now drawn. Bount points at something to the north, in Neverwinter Wood, \"What is this drawn here? It looks like a bird next to a house, right? That reminds me of that hunter we heard about. His name was Falcon, right?\" As they discuss, the tabaxi seems intrigued with the hunter, but the other two press the importance of trying to help Alphonse and the locals around here. They continue to try and decrypt the slightly mysterious markings on the map. \"Is that a dragon over a castle?\" asks Chappy, leaning and squinting at something over the Sword Mountains. \"It looks like it,\" Nyoma replies, \"And over there, one over the Wood also.\" The tabaxi quickly cuts in, \"I'd like to remind everyone of our previously stated strict no dragon hunting policy!\"</p>\n        <img src=\"./images/session_6_map.png\" className=\"session-img img-shadow\" alt=\"Session 6 Map\" />\n        <p>As they finish with the map, Nyoma summarizes her finding from the journal. She explains Hamun and Nine Fingers Jasper were investigating a millenia-past conflict between giants and dragons, which they believe could be better understood with the assistance of some \"Great Stone.\" The red wizard seemed to believe that stone played a role in the decimation of Conyberry. The pair were at Old Owl Well looking for archaeological clues related to Conyberry, but the only significant find they had uncovered was an ancient ring from the Empire of Nethril. At this, the tiefling spots the ring on Bount's finger. She inquires, \"Excuse me, Bount? Could I ask where you go that?\" The tabaxi: \"Oh, yeah, this. It was in the lockbox! I don't know what it is, but I do know I like how it makes me feel. This ring is great.\" Nyoma: \"That's fantastic. You know I can identify objects like that with my powers, right? Maybe you should let me try?\" It takes some convincing to get Bount to take the ring off, and even after he does so he manages to foul one attempt by Nyoma to identify it with constant pestering, but she eventually uncovers the ancient artifact is a Ring of Protection.</p>\n        <p>The group eventually decides to bed down for the night, before heading south to the mountain door.</p>\n        <p>A few dozen miles away and three days ago, Pandjed has bid farewell to his companions in Phandalin and must find his own way out of town. He happens on a horse owned by a villager. Staring at the horse for a while, the dragonborn is mometarily torn over the ethics of taking the animal for his own benefit. He pulls out his coin purse, and removes 15 gold pieces. \"A fair price for a horse, when the exchange assists one directed by prophecy,\" the paladin thinks to himself. And away he rides, out of Phandalin to the east. He keeps an eye out for his companions and searches for them for a few hours, but he does not encounter them. Deciding this is the hand of fate, and that if they are to meant to meet again it will surely happen, Pandjed rides out to the east. He travels to the place he came here to seek out: the Shrine of Savras, sacred and defiled.</p>\n        <p>Back at the present time, it is now morning. After a quick and simple breakfast of porridge, Bount, Nyoma, and Chappy walk south. They travel up and down rolling foothills that slowly increase in height, as they broach the true beginnings of the upswell of the Sword Mountains. About mid-afternoon, the trio crests the top of a hill and are shocked to see Pandjed the dragonborn paladin riding along the lower edge of the hill, deliberately and with purpose, completel unaware of them. They shout and wave happily, and the dragonborn turns to spot them, shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand. Pandjed waves and says nothing. The trio quickly runs down the hill toward him. </p>\n        <p>The reunion between Pandjed and the other three involves excited babbling on their parts as they explain the momentous events of the last few days, and taciturn silence from the paladin. Pandjed asks just one question, \"What happened to my horse?\" Nyoma responds, \"Well, we tried to do our best by the horses, but when we got the barrier around Big Al's they couldn't bring the horses in. They even wanted to eat them, but we wouldn't let them do that! So... hopefully they ran off and are enjoying grass in a field somewhere?\" The dragonborn just looks down and away with a neutral expression on his face: \"My poor horse.\" Chappy says to Bount, sotto voce: \"You know, I forgot how weird this guy is.\" But Bount speaks up to the whole group, \"No offense, but how do we know Pandjed is who he says he is? I mean seriously no offense, but some of the things that have happened to me in the last day or two...\" It takes the group a while to convince the tabaxi, and he even quizzes Pandjed a time or two to verify his identify. Bount then begins pondering how unlikely it is that they have found each other again, trying to rationalize and see it as something likely to happen. Pandjed just interjects, \"This is the will of the Gods.\"</p>\n        <p>The group, now numbering five with Clash, continues south. At what would otherwise be dusk – since the sun has continued to refuse to appear in the sky, casting the entire day as dusk at lightest – they reach their destination, and are confronted by two massive 40 foot high bulwarks of smooth solid stone extending from the mountain, divided by an iron portcullis with a great set of double doors beyond it. They peer through the portcullis, and Nyoma is able to read an inscription hastily carved into the door: \"THIS WAS ONCE DUNNSALA. NOW IT IS NOTHING. THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU HERE. LEAVE QUICKLY AND NEVER RETURN.\" Perhaps expectedly, this does not dissuade them, though Clash eagerly offers to go scout out a safe place in which to set up camp outside. Chappy notices one or two chimneys poking above a ridge up the mountainside. But the bulwarks also possess arrow slits just large enough for a halfling to pass through, and the others eventually convince Chappy to climb in and take a look, with Nyoma coming shortly after via magical means.</p>\n        <p>Chappy squeezes through, finding herself in a dark and chaotic room. Nyoma appears in a cloud of mist in the room beside Chappy, and creates magical light on the halfling's wide-brimmed pointed hat to illuminate the space. The room is strewn with debris, but seems to have played a role in the defense of the fortress, with large wooden ballistae against each arrow slit. The two locate a winch and are able to raise the portcullis, but Bount and Pandjed still find themselves behind the set of double doors. \"We'll wait here while you find a way to get this open,\" Bounty of Nonsense calls out. Turning back to Pandjed, he says, \"So, um... this god thing. How is that working?\" Nyoma and Chappy square up against a door leading out of the current room, preparing to explore in order to find their way back to the doors.</p>\n        <p>The halfling bard sneaks her way down a hallway, finding herself in some kind of receiving room that used to be nicely appointed with now-rotten carpets and tapestries and small wall decorations, seemingly of a religious nature. The room is also decorated with piles of bones. And as Chappy steps foot into the room, the piles assemble themselves into grotesque undead hunched hyena shapes! Nyoma rushes into the room, and she and Chappy engage in battle while yelling to their compatriots. Hearing their yells on the edge of their heading, Pandjed and Bount suddenly realize the urgency of the situation and begin desperately thundering against the door, attempting to break it down. After several attempts the double doors splinter and break open, allowing the pair to enter a great hall with a cavernously tall ceiling. The tabaxi and the dragonborn rush through a door to the west into the receiving room to help their friends, with Bount slamming the door behind them.</p>\n        <p>The four vigorously battle the animated gnoll skeletons, but they hear an ominously loud crash and bang from somewhere in the direction of the great hall. Unable to spare much attention from the slashing and biting of the ravenous piles of bones and rags, they focus on the matter at hand. But just as the last of the bone creatures has been pounded to dust, a violent banging is heard against the doors leading to the receiving room. Bount tries to block the door, but before he can get himself properly set the doors slam open, allowing a tidal wave of rotten fur and flesh and black ichor dripping from hungering mouths access to the room. More gnolls have come to dine. </p>\n        <p>A long, desperate struggle is fought against the gnolls, eventually spilling out into the middle of the great hall. At last the gnolls have been vanquished, and the adventurers are bloody and dirty and more or less covered in the black oily viscous that the gnolls seem to continuously ooze. They take shelter behind a pillar in the corner to rest. Bount lies on the ground, recovering from his wounds, and Chappy subtly reaches out and scratches him behind the ears. The tabaxi hesitates for just a second or two, before purring ever so slightly. After a few minutes of this, Bount looks up at Chappy, \"What was that spell you cast on me? Heroism? That was... wow. It was like being tipsy, but in the best way. But also strange, so strange.\" While resting, they assess the grand room they find themselves in. Aside from the now-destroyed double doors leading out to the north, there are three smaller sets of double doors in this room, each in cardinal directions and each topped with a sigil in the lintel above carved as a bas relief in stone. The doors to the west – to the receiving room – carry a sigil of a crystal ball marked by an eye in the center. \"That is of Savras, God of Propecy and to whom I have sworn my service,\" intones Pandjed. The doors to the south are marked by a carving of a gemstone underneath the outline of a mountain, and to the east is a sigil of a ring of alchemical and mathematical symbols and formulae. Nyoma considers them for a second, then explains, \"I've definitely read about these before. The gemstone represents Dumathoin, Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain. He's the patron diety of shield dwarves. Probably the chief god in this place. And the other one, that's a gnome god of invention called Nebelun the Meddler. A lot of people think he's just an aspect of Gond, but no one really knows.\"</p>\n        <p>After resting for nearly an hour, the four decide to continue exploring to the west. Returning to the receiving room, they examine the three doors in the room and pick one at random. It leads to toilets, shielded with chainmail curtains. Bount grabs a curtain momentarily, before realizing the strength of the stench attached to it, upon which he discards it. They then head north, through a particularly fancing decorated set of doors. They find themselves in a disguting mess of a room that was clearly once ornately decorated and arranged: the Shrine of Savras. The floor and all surfaces are covered both in oily black ichor and in grayish sticky thick mucus. In the middle of the room is a vast crystal ball, absolutely slathered in mucus, and around the edges are small tables and bookcases and other surfaces piled with ritual objects, prognosticatory devices, books, papers, and miscellanea, now strewn about.  And at the other end of the room a raised stone dais, upon which lies a massive, grotesque distorted frog-thing. The frog-thing rests its head against a baroquely carved stone altar, and on top of the altar sits a shining white warhammer, the sole object totally clean in this chaos. The froglike creature stares at the group with massive bulging eyes and growls aggressively. Pandjed, his face a mask of passion and anger, charges into the room at the frog. His companions join him in battle.</p>\n        <p>Pandjed leaps toward the frog, with Bount behind him. But the frog suddenly dematerializes in the dim light, and pops back into existence beside the crystal ball, behind the tabaxi. It stands on hind legs momentarily, and attempts to close its wet rubbery jaws around the rogue, but he slips out of the way at the last moment. Pandjed and the others turn around and rain blows down upon the frog, trying to get it away from Bount. It zips out of reality again, this time surprising Nyoma by popping back in almost on top of her. This time it is able to grip the tiefling with its tongue and pulls her bodily into its mouth. Gulping a deep horrible thrum, Nyoma disappears as the frog-thing swallows. At this, Pandjed's eyes shine with determination. He storms out of the room, and gripping his flail with intensity, he channels every ounce of the divine power given to him by Savras into a single blow. It connects, and the frog monster explodes! The receiving room is covered in mucus and frog flesh and there is Nyoma, largely unharmed by entirely shocked, on the floor and covered in gunk.</p>\n        <p>The four return to the room. Pandjed takes the warhammer and studies it, while Chappy sets to magically cleaning the Shrine. Nyoma offers to take the warhammer and spends a while communing with its energies. Handing it back to Pandjed, she informs him, \"It's the Lightbringer. I read about this, it's a powerful mysitcal artifact that was once used to protect the Forge of Spells before both the Forge and the hammer were lost.\"</p>\n        <p>As this is happening, Bount heads back to the room with the arrow slits to see if there has been any change outside. It is night, and the ominous cloud cover continues. Returning and reporting that nothing seems to have changed, the tabaxi suddenly seems overwhelmed. \"What are we even doing here? Is this actually something we can do anything about? Maybe we should just get out of here.\" The others do their best to convince him of their purpose here. Nyoma says, \"It's good we're here. Even if we haven't figured out how to bring the sun back, we've been able to help Pandjed do what he came here to do. We were able to cleanse this shrine!\" Bount replies, \"Yeah, that's all well and good. There just seems so much horribleness and so much danger here. What, are there two more shrines? Is it all going to be more horrible frog monsters and biting jaws and blood and death? Maybe we just need to find someone here to talk to, reason with here. Maybe we could... I don't know, convince them to leave?\" Chappy seems skeptical: \"What are you talking about Bount? What would we even say?\" Bount: \"I don't know! We could lie to them, we could get them to go somewhere else!\" Chappy gawps at him, \"My family is in danger here! You want to just kick this down the road for someone else to deal with?\"</p>\n        <p>The tabaxi looks chagrined and says, \"No, of course not. I just, I just want to know what we're getting into here. Not on faith, but on evidence. I know you all have a lot of faith about what we're doing, can't we combine the power of faith with the knowledge of being able to handle what's to come?\" Nyoma: \"If we can even find that knowledge.\" Chappy: \"Yeah, how, Bount?\" The tabaxi shrugs his shoulders, \"Like I said, I don't know. I just didn't expect all this. We started out doing one thing and then we have to do this and that and that and I just didn't anticipate all this when I signed up to move some cargo to get out of Neverwinter for a while!\" Pandjed pipes up: \"… I did not anticipate the frog.\" This causes the others to suddenly collapse into laughter, breaking the tension. As a way to help calm his nerves, Nyoma offers Bount The Mask Within, so that he might be able to use it to detect sapient thoughts and be better warned about any surprises to come. He takes it graciously, thanking her, and as the group settles down for a good rest and some sleep, he pulls some paints out of his disguise kit. Calmly and methodically, he carefully paints feline whiskers and fur on the mask, matching his own.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 7) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>A sudden rumble of the earth shakes Nyoma out of her quiet meditative trance. It is early morning, and Chappy, Bount, and Pandjed all startle awake as the ground quakes beneath them and a low rumbling can be heard at a distance. The tiefling had been communing with the prophecy-god Savras in the way most familiar to her, giving thanks for sheltering in the now-recovered Shrine by ritually dictating recent events and knowledge in prayer. Bount, squinting his eyes on waking and trying to make sense of the situation, looks over at Nyoma and, seeing the slightly panicked look on her face, tries to make sense of things: \"Did you do this? Is this, a, er, a magic thing?\" Nyoma yells back, \"I don't think so! It shouldn’t be! But - \" she is cut off by the sudden ceasing of the earth's shifting beneath their feet. A short slightly panicked conversation ensues, followed by the eventual resolve – or resignation in the case of the tabaxi – to finish exploring the rest of the abandoned dwarven fortress-temple of Dunnsala, to try and seek the source of the quaking.</p>\n        <p>Nyoma sends Kevin to the main hall, where the owl detects a smaller low moaning behind the southern exit from the hall. The group cautiously approaches, and opens the southern exit to find themselves in a short narrow hallway leading to a second set of doors. These doors are completely covered in the viscous black ichor seen elsewhere in the temples and across the region – except here, the oily black substance seems to be seeping out of the TOP of the door, as if being dribbled out by some gravity-defying fountain and flowing across the ceiling and upper walls outside. Baffled, the group once again pauses, before Bount pulls out The Face Within and slides it over his face, extending his thoughts south toward the omnipresent moaning. He detects a small, pale gray presence, pulsating slowly, but any further concentration that is suddenly ceased by an overpowering black malevolence around the edges of the tabaxi's perception. The rogue is almost overwhelmed by this, but it largely increases the curiosity of the others and their desire to see more. Finally, Nyoma grows impatient and moves forward, flinging open the second set of doors with magical force.</p>\n        <p>The sight awaiting the group inside is shocking. As if the fortress-temple beyond them has been broken up into chunks and digested into some obscenely massive black-hued stomach, islands of stone floor and broken walls float and bob slowly in all-surrounding sea-sphere of dark ichor. The ichor spans gaps in the floor, but also covers most of the outer walls and the ceilings, and the flow of ichor seems to flow upward in defiance of all natural laws. Before being broken up, this room was clearly once a throne room, with a central island sporting three dwarf-sized thrones. And in the center, a pillar of black ooze extends from the ceiling down to the stone throne, and in the ooze is suspended an ancient skeletal corpse wearing a brass crown and, seemingly, a living, moaning, unconscious individual intertwined with the skeleton.</p>\n        <p>The tall figure hanging from the ooze, suspending in mid-air along with the once-royal skeleton, wears a long coat with some kind of rigidness hidden underneath, and a long thin sword in a scabbard at his side. The four others pause for a moment agape at the sight in front of them, before Nyoma raises her hand and extends a wave of positive arcane force toward the figure, rousing him to consciousness. His eyes flip open, he struggles, and realizing his situation, he screams incoherently momentarily before deciding to narrow the scream to a set of specific words: \"Where am I, and what did YOU do to me?!\" There is momentary confusion between the long-coated individual, still strung up in the ooze, and the party, but eventually the tiefling warlock harnesses a sphere of galaxy-energy and unleashes it to cut the sword-wielder down from the ooze. After a tense moment, he introduces himself: \"I'm Enoch. I was trying to get something, and... well... I'm honestly not sure what happened. I know this place did not look like this.\" The party is similarly confused, but they introduce themselves in turn. Bount specifically majestically draws his rapier with a theatrical flourish and announces himself as Bount of Nonsense, honored officer of the Flaming Fist Mercenary Company. Enoch watches this, and lets out a sharp surprised laugh to see such drama in these surroundings. The tabaxi seems displeased.</p>\n        <p>After freeing Enoch, the five together take notice of a strange mural behind the thrones. In a two-dimensional profile it seems to depict a long mountain ridge with a forest in front of and below the ridge. On the left hand side of the mountain ridge is the dwarven Law rune, and on the right hand side are both the dwarven Creation and Human runes. In the forest, atop the center of the mountain, and above the Human rune are raised carved polyhedral shapes, each one a different polyhedron. And above the Law rune is an inverted polyhedral space or socket of sorts. Chappy and Nyoma both begin excitedly discussing this find, with Nyoma musing, \"It looks like a puzzle! Maybe we have to find this last shape and place it in the mural? But wait, this shape over the Human rune looks like the pyramid-shaped polyhedron we already have, but bigger? We couldn't fit it in here.\" Chappy squints with thought, before opining, \"I think it's supposed to be more illustrative than actual, Nyoma.\" The tiefling warlock seems unsatisfied with his idea.</p>\n        <img src=\"./images/session_7_mural.jpg\" className=\"session-img img-shadow\" alt=\"Session 7 Mural\" />\n        <p>But further consideration is cut off by another greater quaking of the ground beneath them, sending the islands of floor shifting unpleasantly in the black up-dripping ichor. A deep violent rumbling is heard off to the east, followed by an explosion, and followed shortly after by THINGS crawling up out of the ichorous muck! Horrific gross parodies of form, giant fang-mawed mouths with stumpy legs and eyes dangling from compound-jointed stalks, suddenly swim up out of the black oily viscousness and set themselves upon the characters! The four plus Enoch dispatch them easily enough, with Bounty of Nonsense launching several arrows into the creatures before casting his bow down and entering the fray with sword and dagger. As the five seem to be getting the better of the maw-demons, the earth once more quakes and an even louder explosive noise is heard once more. Bount, with feline grace, launches himself onto the east-most throne-room island and, using his claws for traction, leans himself around the broken wall to get a glimpse at the even more disconcerting sight awaiting them.</p>\n        <p>The source of rumbling is a large room-chunk floating in the corruptive filth, in the center of which is a bizarre object shaped almost like a halfing-sized bronze coffin, inscribed with a myriad of esoteric pictograms and surrounded by a whirling blurred cloud of ominously shaped and inscribed pieces of metal, wood, gems, and other less identifiable materials. From within the obviously old but still shining artifact is some kind of central humanoid-shaped glow, and it is from this that occasional explosions and rumbles issue forth. With each rumble a rainbow-hued lightning bolt arcs from within the glowing center, and where the bolt lands, a sudden gout of black filth erupts from the interceding surface. But also around this object is a swirling melee, as a gigantic five-armed golem is surrounded by cackling, shrieking gnolls, trying to bite and tear at the metal behemoth as it attempts to throw them from the platform. \"YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED,\" the golem intones in a grinding atonal satire of a voice, its head swiveling all the way around the face the tabaxi leaning around the wall. </p>\n        <p>\"Uh, guys?\" Bounty of Nonsense calls back, \"I found the... ooze shooter?\" \"What the hell is that?\" Chappy yells over. The tabaxi turns back around momentarily, \"Well, it's, ah. It's bad – and it's mad. It's bad and mad.\" The halfling looks at the ground for a second, just for a second, before responding: \"Then that sounds like what we have to deal with to stop all of this. Let's go.\" And for once, Bount just nods, and they do.</p>\n        <p>The five begin making their way to the central room-chunk with Pandjed leading the way, but end up held at a choke point, the remnant of a narrow tunnel, now without walls and floating as the only point of connection between the throne-room islands and where the artifact, golem, and gnolls sit. There another maw-demon climbs out of the ichor to assault Pandjed Seeing them approach, some of the gnolls maneuver away from the golem and being peppering the group with arrows. Pandjed is able to handily shrug these off, batting them away with his shield as he strikes at the maw-demon with the hammer Lightbringer. But the maw-demon accomplishes splitting the group, as Pandjed eventually makes the leap to the central island while Enoch, Chappy, Bount, and Nyoma find themselves battling gnolls on a long twisting remnant of a staircase, tilting dangerously over in the oily black muck.</p>\n        <p>Chappy and Nyoma race to the top of the stairs, gaining a vantage point on the central island and seeking to do anything they can to help Pandjed there. The halfling squares up, and looks over at Nyoma: \"I can't believe I'm finally getting to use this!\" The tiefling looks back quizzically as the bard flips over her lute and begins to beat percussively on the underside of the instrument. Chappy intones in a flat affect: \"Hammer calls you! Tongs call you! Be born once more!\" And all of a sudden, the golem begins to glow white-hot, with waves of heat streaming off its surface and bending the air around it. The grinding metallic voice now becomes a cacophony of broken syllables, but it continues to battle on against the gnolls, searing the hyenas as it grabs them. But in this tumult it seems not to notice Pandjed on the other end of the island, trading hammer blows for glaive swipes with a massively large gnoll, snarling orders at the other smaller half-living hyena creatives. </p>\n        <p>Meanwhile further below down the stairs, Enoch and Bount fend off gnolls climbing up out of the viscous ooze to overwhelm them. They are joined by Chappy as she descends the tilting, careening stairs, and Bount looks over his shoulder toward the top of the stairs. \"Hey, new guy!\" He motions to Enoch, \"Take this!\" He throws Enoch a potion, before retreating up the stairs. There the tabaxi joins Nyoma, who is sending blasts of magical force down to the central island to assist with the melee there. Bount points at the artifact: \"Nyoma. Look at this, I noticed it when I was watching before.\" the artifact once again rumbles and explodes, a chunk of the whirling debris surrounding it actually flies off and away, leading to another lightning arc and another spout of ichor where the arc lands. \"See how part of it comes away? I think maybe, possibly, if we could destroy that thing that would help? Or make this way worse? I don't know, but I left my bow back there...\" He does not get to continue, for in this moment the massive gnoll below gouges Pandjed grievously, and the paladin hits the ground, unconscious. Nyoma thinks for a moment, before quickly reaching behind her and handing the tabaxi a hand crossbow and some bolts. \"Sure, okay. You try that. I've got to go do something massively, incredibly stupid. Wish me luck!\" And with that, the warlock vanishes into thin air at the top of the stairs and remanifests on the central island, not far from Pandjed's fallen body.</p>\n        <p>The combat rages on. Enoch and Chappy valiantly try to hold off the gnolls at the bottom of the stairs, with Enoch only barely hanging onto consciousness as they battle on. Nyoma swings wildly with her mystically-enhanced staff, trying at the same time to both beat away the gnolls and heal Pandjed back into consciousness. Bount carefully aims the crossbow, and fires into the glowing heart of the artifact once, then twice. Each time yet more whirling pieces break off and fly away, and greater and greater multicolored lightning arcs appear to wreak havoc. Nyoma is able to once wake Pandjed, but he is struck by this lightning before hitting the ground once more. Another gnoll latches its jaws into Chappy's shoulder, and she swoons and falls as well. Enoch faces two gnolls at once, clutching his side desperately to staunch the bleeding. He shrugs off his coat and throws it on top of Chappy's fallen form, granting to her some measure of protection, in what he presumes is one of the last decisions he will ever make. Finally, Bounty of Nonsense launches one final crossbow bolt directly into the center of the glowing light and heat of the whirling coffin-like device, and the entire room disappears in a sudden bright white immolation of cold fire.</p>\n        <p>In a few moments, the all-consuming light recedes. The five blink and squint and, at last, are able to assess the situation. The golem is in pieces, and all of the gnolls are no more than oily black stains on the stone floor. The artifact is destroyed, but among a scattering of twisted bronze and shattered occult components is the withered, desiccated husk of a humanoid that seems to have once been a gnome, as well as a brilliant blue eight-sided rune-inscribed polyhedron nestled between the remnants of what would have once been the husk's hands. But more alarmingly, the ooze on which the islands float – and which coats the walls and ceilings – is rippling ominously, backed by a threating and increasingly loud rumbling down deep. Enoch yells from the bottom of the stairs, \"I think it's time to GO!\" Bount points at the blue object and calls to Nyoma, \"Grab that!\" Nyoma meanwhile is running at a full clip and shouts back, \"Already on it!\"  The five leap from island to island over the ichor, and manage to flee back into the main hall just as the ceiling begins to give out, closing the way behind them with massive rubble and debris.</p>\n        <p>After a few moments of shocked silence, Nyoma pipes up: \"Can we... rest?\" But Bount swings to face Enoch and says, \"Can we find out who you are? I mean, I appreciate the help, but I'd still like to know.\" The swordsman responds, \"Like I said before, my name is Enoch. I came here to recover certain lost magical artifacts for the library of my King in a distant land. And now that I have this,\" he raises the signet ring he took from the hand of the skeleton on the throne, \"And now THAT is over and done with, I'd like to go find the treasure I came here for. Though... I'm pretty sure all the stairs in this place were in the part that's now fallen down.\" And with that, Enoch moves to eye the second-floor balcony in the main hall, gathering some ropes to climb it, as Bount studies him. He heads off to find his treasure, but Nyoma instructs Kevin the Owl to accompany him. A few minutes later, Nyoma is narrating the contents of a chest Enoch had located - \"Oh, Chappy! There's a lute there, it's beautiful... all filigreed with silver!\" - that is, until the tabaxi interrupts them: \"Wait, everyone. Look at the windows. Sunlight!\" And indeed, the upper-level windows shine with bright sunlight of the sort the party hasn't seen for days.</p>\n        <p>After Enoch returns, and hesitantly agrees to lend Chappy the lute he found – clearly thrumming with arcane power – in exchange for them saving his life, the five rest for roughly an hour before determining to leave this accursed place they have occupied for the last two days. \"But first, let's uh, well let's make sure the coast is clear,\" says Bounty of Nonsense. He sneaks gingerly up to the destroyed double entrance doors, before peering out of the murky interior down the entranceway and out into the field beyond. And his worst fears are realized. Out of the fortress, Bount counts maybe a dozen figures, though it's hard to tell at this distance. And accompanying the figures, a call rings out from the field: \"Oh, intrepid 'venturers! Please do come outside, that we might be properly acquainted.\" The clipped tones quite clearly belong to none other than Iarno Albrek.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 8) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p><i>In a quick flashback to before the party discovered Iarno outside Dunnsala, they explored the bedroom of a priest of Savras who worked and lived in Dunnsala in ages past. There they found the priest's diary, which is included here:</i></p>\n        <img src=\"./images/session_8_diary.jpg\" className=\"session-img img-shadow\" alt=\"Session 8 Diary\" />\n        <p>Iarno's presence outside the dwarven fortress causes general panic among the party of Bounty of Nonsense, Nyoma, Chappy, Pandjed, and Enoch. Sneaking up to peer outward, Enoch and Bount spy a collection of figures. Glasstaff herself, but also Hamun Kost the Red and Nine-Fingers Jasper, over half a dozen ambulatory skeletons, and two hobgoblin soldiers flanking a hostage: Clash. \"I have your goblin,\" Iarno loudly calls down the dark entrance passage to the fortress. \"I do not want this to come to violence. I only want to speak with you concerning what you have taken from me. Return it and we can be cordial with each other.\" </p>\n        <p>In response to seeing Clash there, the tabaxi immediately flees back inside, breathing in panicked syncopation. Bount tears away from the others and climbs the rope to the second floor, searching for some other kind of exit. Chappy and Nyoma catch up to him as he finds a decent-sized hole in the ceiling, with the rotted remnants of some aged climbing gear and a rope dangling down to the floor where they are. The halfling and the tiefling try to calm Bount down, but he agonizedly unravels his guilt and anxiety over how they seem to go from bad to worse over and over, and this time he feels like he has endangered Clash. Chappy tries to calm him down, \"Listen. We are all in this together, and we'll figure out how to get Clash out of this.\" She looks down at the new silver-filigreed lute in her hand, it still thrumming occult harmonic vibrations up and down her arms. \"You know... I think I can get you up there to the top. And then when you're there, I also think I can keep them from seeing you. You can get close to Clash!\" Bount: \"Is this some magic nonsense again? I'm sorry, but no. No. I just can't.\" They retreat back to the first floor.  </p>\n        <p>The group hurriedly debates options. Enoch demands to know who Iarno is. \"Well,\" starts Nyoma, \"she is someone we made really unhappy. We took some of her things, see. But we were completely justified, she was overseeing a gang squeezing the life out of this town!\" Enoch nods, \"And the other wizard-looking guy?\" Chappy this time: \"We... also made them pretty angry. Completely separate event from Iarno, but we also took their stuff. In our defense there, they kind of deserved it for being shitty.\" Enoch responds, \"Wow. You all sure carve a path. Hm. Obviously, I don't believe she's up to any good. One does not bring walking skeletons for diplomacy. What to do about that hostage, though?\" Bount: \"I have no idea. If we go out there, they will kill Clash. There is NOTHING we can do here.\" Pandjed considers that a moment before piping up in his typical monotone, \"Ah, but once they kill the hostage, then the advantage of their hostage will be gone. They won't have leverage anymore.\" This does not seem to convince the others.</p>\n        <p>At least, Chappy convinces Bount to give her initial plan a go. She and Bount return to the second floor, along with Nyoma who takes up a position at an arrow slot on the second floor outer wall. At the same time, Enoch and Pandjed proceed outward to try to bluff Iarno. Enoch claims he and his dragonborn companion have not seen those the wizard is seeking, but that he and Pandjed are capable with arms and could be valuable to Iarno if hired to assist her. She responds positively but impatiently, and increasingly so as Enoch attempts to spin out the negotiations to buy the others more time. Up above, Bount of Nonsense looks at the halfling bard with trepidation and anxiety run rampant. Chappy begins to pluck the lute in an airy melody of increasing tempo, and before he even realizes it, the tabaxi has been lifted several inches off the air! He only barely manages to keep himself from shouting in alarm, and grits his teeth for what is to come as he slowly floats up and out of the room onto the ledge at the top. Chappy's tune changes to a slippery, mercurial ballad and Bount suddenly realizes he can no longer see his hands in front of his face! He is now somehow impossible to see. Marveling at this but aware of what must be done, he steals away down the cliffside to Iarno's group and Clash below.</p>\n        <p>As Bounty of Nonsense places himself right behind the two hobgoblins flanking Clash, Iarno is beginning to get increasingly aggravated with Enoch and Pandjed's prevarication and stalling tactics. Finally, the tabaxi summons up his courage and rushes forward, stabbing one hobgoblin and barreling the other off the short ridge they were standing on. He then turns and begins bounding off into the trees nearby, shouting at Clash as he does so: \"RUN! NOW!\" But Clash does not move. She does not even shift to register Bount's voice, or his presence, or the hobgoblin dead on the ground or the other one tumbling down the ridge. Chappy, who has placed herself at an arrow slot on the first floor peering outward at the events, suddenly feels her blood run ice-cold. \"No. Oh, NO. Clash was an illusion all along!\"</p>\n        <p>In response to this sudden turn of events, all hell breaks loose. The hobgoblin rolling down the ridge lets out a shout and a cry, and suddenly Iarno, Hamun, Jasper, and the skeletons take notice of the feline rogue that is now sprinting on all fours away toward thicker tree cover to the west. Iarno screams out a command to the other two: \"Get him! Do not let him escape!\" And Jasper tears off at speed after Bounty of Nonsense. Hamun speaks in a grating arcane speech laced with iron, and the collection of skeletons lurches alive, turning as one collective entity, off behind the tabaxi. But before any of those clustered near the fortress entrance can do much, an inky black magical darkness engulfs all those present. From the second floor, Nyoma has just unleashed the incantation inscribed on a magical scroll, sucking all available light out of a large area on the ground. Bedlam ensues.  </p>\n        <p>In the darkened melee, it is hard to tell friend from foe. Enoch approaches Iarno, claiming to be in service and here to assist her. But when he feels her close enough in the darkness, he silently plunges the long, thin blade of his sword into her side. She chokes out a sudden surprised noise, but can not get much more out before Enoch stabs her again, and again. She stumbles back, and again as Pandjed approaches, and the wizard seems to gather the arcane shadows thickly in her hands, before unleashing them on the dragonborn. The paladin feels the shadows crawl into his mind, and suddenly his worst fear explodes into vision – the oracular crystall ball eye of Savras, cast upon Pandjed with only disappointment and abandonment filling its gaze. The dragonborn cries out, fighting against the shadowy corruption, and swings his hammer as the dark figure commanding the darkness. The hammer encounters resistance in the dark, and Iarno Albrek crumples to the ground. She is broken.</p>\n        <p>Outside the dark, Bounty of Nonsense continues to flee from his pursuers. With them hot on his heels, he suddenly hears something trampling through the bushes. \"Oh, god. What NOW?\" And all at once, a horse emerges from the trees... with Clash on its back! \"What are you doing here?!\" Bount cries out. \"What are YOU doing? What's all this?! Ugh, nevermind, just climb on!\" The tabaxi does so, and the goblin begins to turn the horse to ride away from Dunnsala. Bounty puts a hand on her shoulder and grimly says, \"No. We can't. At least not yet. The others are still back there. We have to go back.\" Clash: \"Are you kidding me? That really doesn't sound like us.\" Bount: \"I know. And still.\" Clash wheels the horse back around, toward the fray.  </p>\n        <p>But fortunately, as the ride up, the darkness dissipates, like steam boiling away all at once. Hamun and Jasper quail when they see the crumpled body of Iarno. Hamun falls to his knees in surrender, and Jasper attempts to flee north into the trees and bushes. Nyoma and Chappy cast some spells just over his head, and Jasper tumbles to his knees in surrender.</p>\n        <p>The five have a moment to breath, before considering what to do with their captives. Though Bount wastes no time with one question as he moves Jasper: \"So, uh, looks like we finally get to find out. Why nine fingers, eh? You don't have a necklace we should know about, do you?\" Jasper looks up at him, \"Ugh, that's horrible! What's wrong with you? No! It's the number of lady's rings I took off their fingers. By THEFT.\" In response to this, everyone pauses. \"I don't know what I was expecting, but I feel disappointed,\" says Chappy. Bount laughs, \"Who knew Jasper was such a lady's man? In any case, if you two don't mind it, I think we'll be having a few more questions for you.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 9) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Hamun Kost the Red, the wizard with the arcane forehead tattoo, and Nine-Fingers Jasper, his thief companion, sit on the ground on their knees, their hands bound behind them. Chappy, Nyoma, Bounty of Nonsense, Pandjed, and Enoch stare them down for a few moments before questioning them. The red wizard is eager to please, but Jaspers mainly feeds them sass. They learn the pair only met Iarno a few days prior, where she offered them employment both to chase the party and also to investigate something in the Starmetal Hills. \"She let slip once that she knew very little about her employer, this Black Spider,\" Hamun bawls. \"And despite their wide-ranging search, she and the hobgoblins were completely forbidden to enter those Hills, on pain of death. I suppose this must have made her curious, because she offered us further gold to accompany her to some place known as 'the observatory' after we encountered you.\"</p>\n        <p>The group discusses further whether to let the pair go, and also whether to divest them of their goods, and additionally whether it might be smart to employ them. Enoch favors relieving them of their possessions, and Pandjed of possibly hiring them, but Bount is worried about possible fallout from both. There is also a tangential conversation about Hamun's academic researchs into understanding what destroyed Conyberry. While Nyoma seems quite intrigued by this, Chappy and others express some distaste at the level of amorality involved. Nyoma does request that they undo whatever happened to Conyberry, if they learn a way to do so. In the end, they let them go, and both groups express fervent desires never to see each other ever again. </p>\n        <p>After ensuring Hamun and Jasper are long gone, the group stands around uneasily in front of Dunnsala, debating next moves. Enoch excuses himself to retrieve his climbing gear from inside the fortress, but when he returns expresses confusion at the decayed and moldering nature of his rope and other goods. Nyoma looks thoughtful, \"Speaking of that, could you tell us more where you've come from? We only got the briefest mention previously.\" Enoch explains he is or was a magistrate for the King of far-away Cormyr, ordered to search distant lands for magical artifacts and ancient knowledge. He also regretfully says that not long after he left, his King was deposed and murdered by avaricious Barons, but although he is without a King he believes in the wisdom of the order and has continued to pursue it. A look of bafflement spreads upon the faces of Chappy and Nyoma, as they both together manage to stammer out that the fall of the dynasty of Cormyr happened a generation ago, nearly twenty years or so. Enoch is stunned into silence on learning this, and excuses himself to take a walk in the forest to think.  </p>\n        <p>As to where to go next, Chappy pushes the others to travel north so that she might check on her Uncle Al Kalazorn and the others left behind at his farmstead. The others agree, and Bount looks over to Clash: \"With the farmstead presumably safe, we could probably find work for you there now. You could be out of the frying pan that just keeps heating up under us.\" The goblin looks away at the dirt off to the side and eventually says, \"About that... I've been doing a lot of thinking. What would you think if, maybe, I were to just stay here? You all seem more than capable of handling yourselves in a fight, so you're nice to be around for that, but also if it wasn't for me you would have lost all of your supplies in that fight. It looks like you could just an clerk, or an adjutant. I'm not much with a weapon, but I know logistics!\" There is general surprise at this, with Nyoma the most enthusiastically in favor and Bounty of Nonsense cautious. He says, \"Are you sure about that? This group, or what we've been doing at least, is dangerous.\" Clash replies: \"Maybe so. But you don't care that I'm a goblin, and you know...\" Bount: \"Is this you admitting we're friends? if you're comfortable admitting we are your friends, than yeah, of course you're welcome to stick around.\" Clash begrudgingly admits the friendship, and the bargain is struck. </p>\n        <p>With Enoch having returned, the six now set off north, descending the foothills of the Sword Peaks. They pass an uneventful night camping, and continue their hike in the next day.</p>\n        <p>About mid-morning, the group is stunned to spot a dragon! Everyone drops to the ground and tries to take cover. A luminous, white, gigantic thing even as far away in the heavens as it is, it traces lazy circles in the sky. Nyoma squints her eyes, \"Do you all see that blackness on the side of its face?\" And indeed, the dragon seems to be marred by some kind of dark growth covering the right side of its head. Fortunately, the creature seems to take no notice of them and moves on, and they are able to continue.</p>\n        <p>Toward the evening of that same day, the six approach Al Kalazorn's farmstead. They see the surrounding barrier wall has been disassembled, and in its place are some tents and the shells of some buildings in mid-construction. They pass children playing outside and adults still working in the twilight, and as they approach many curious eyes stick to the group. A child runs to the farmhouse and, after a moment, Big Al runs outside. He embraces Chappy in a bear hug, and he is sobbing happily. He expresses wonderment and gratefulness that Chappy and her friends survived. After some conversation in which it is established that the group were the ones who seemingly brough the sun back, the old dwarf is reduced to shouts of joy and laughter while tears continue to stream down his face. He insists that they remain for a party, a feast of what remains from the long sojourn through the night. Chappy and the rest gladly assent.</p>\n        <p>The party and feast is raucous. Several trestle tables are set up in the grass under the starlight, and numerous fires are created both for cooking and pleasure. Groups play card and dice games, and at the edge of the field, several burly individuals occupy themselves with a game that involves the throwing of large heavy wooden logs at distance. While the rest of the group remains at the tables eating, Pandjed wanders over and joins the log tossing group. They welcome him, and he loses the first round but wins the second. Back at the tables, the others engage Big Al in further conversation. Nyoma asks about the new construction, and Al explains that the previously scattered rural farmers and ranchers have mostly opted to stay close to this land after their horrible collective experience. \"So I suppose we are creating a sort of township, you could say,\" Big Al says.</p>\n        <p>They talk further of what happened in the dwarven ruins, and Kalazorn is amazed. \"I am afraid I don't have much to thank you with, but as you may know from my dear niece, I was once an adventurer myself. Me and Lydia, who would eventually become my wife, Tyr rest her soul. And I do have this which I will give to you as thanks. Lydia and I found it together, and hopefully it will help you on your way.\" He hands them a leather pouch, with the leather carefully detailed to look as if it were a monstrous face. Having read of these, Nyoma recognizes it as a Bag of Holding.</p>\n        <p>At length, Big Al asks if he might speak with Chappy in private. They go for a walk under the moon, and as they walk Al tells her a bit more about his adventuring days. Chappy's uncle explains he was a member of a fraternity of adventurers known as the Harpers, a group that prizes the accumulation of knowledge and resists the misuse and hoarding of power. He invites the halfling bard to join this fraternity, to carry on the mission that he and her aunt both dearly strove for in their own days of youth. Chappy seems surprised and a little taken aback, but after a moment or two of reflective contemplation, she shyly accepts the offer. Big Al swears her in, having difficulty remembering the exact words after all this time, and at the end he hands her a pewter badge with the Harper's seal raised upon it, a harp and a collection of stars. They hug, and begin to walk back. On the way, Al notes that Lady Graele of Phandalin is also a member, and a more current one than he. \"She should be able to answer any questions you might have, help you if you need assistance, or inform you how you might further the Harper mission. I am very proud of you, my niece.\" </p>\n        <p>The party lasts all night. The next morning, the group recovers over breakfast. As the party eats, a messenger arrives at the farm and heads inside, carrying parcels and letters for Big Al. After a while, Kalazorn passes outside to greet the six gathered there. They have a pleasant conversation, and as he is heading away he turns and says, \"Oh, you might be interested in this.\" He hands them a broadsheet delivered from down Phandalin way. It says: \"Calling all capable sorts! An expedition has arrived to this domain from the great city of Neverwinter. The Flaming Fist and the Rose Knight have arrived with an ambition to slay the wyrm menacing these lands. Reliable types are invited to join, amnesty for prior legal entanglements graciously provided. Come one, come all!\" General amazement is expressed by all that the Flaming Fist actually exists, and is not just something Bounty of Nonsense made up. \"Well, it's interesting,\" Chappy says, \"but I feel like we have more important things to do right now than go dragon hunting.\" Nyoma: \"Agreed. I feel like we should investigate the observatory, whatever in the world that is!\" Bount pauses for a moment, before asking for the broadsheet. He brings it to his nose and inhales. What he smells he does not mentions to the others, but the broadsheet carries a faint but distinct smell of boiled cabbage. He crumples the paper up and puts it in his pocket for later.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 10) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Nyoma, Pandjed, Bounty of Nonsense, Chappy, and Enoch find themselves as the tail end of a long and mostly relaxed breakfast. Bount distractedly scribbles away at two pieces of paper as Clash, now dressed in a newly refurbished Cragmaw uniform absent regimental patches, presents the others with an opportunity to invest in a putative trading enterprise. Also, to buy a horse from the messenger that came from Phandalin way. Nyoma and Chappy accompany Clash to see the horse, and agree to buy it, also choosing to invest some gold coins in Clash's business idea. Bount also catches Clash and absent-mindedly hands over a small bag of gold coins before also placing a letter in her hands. \"Please see to it this reaches my parents? If, you know, anything were to happen.\" Clash nods solemnly, and takes the letter as if it were a precious thing. Bount then mails another letter back to Phandalin with the messenger, not speaking of its contents to anyone.</p>\n        <p>After some discussion with Big Al, the group decides to remain at the farmstead (and slowly growing townstead) for a few days to rest and recuperate. During their time there, two notable things occur.</p>\n        <p>First, Nyoma questions Big Al whether he can notice anything about the broken staff she carries, and if he knows how it might be repaired. He replies once upon a time he could have fixed it, but he has been without artificer's arcane engineering equipment for many a year. But he recognizes the item carries substantial latent power, and someone with the ken and the will ought to be able to do something about it.</p>\n        <p>Second, Chappy is approached by the daughter of the old local woman who was quite nasty to them during their previous stay at Big Al's, during the plague of gnolls. The halfling starts to make a wry joke before learning the old woman is dead. In any case, her daughter asks the adventurers if they might deliver a ritual offering to a place known locally to be associated with spirits. The place is in the Starmetal Hills, and the ritual offering must be placed before (but not on) the Feast of the Moon, three days hence on the 31st of Uktar, The Rotting. Chappy agrees, and the woman hands her a slightly mysterious sack filled with ritual offering goods to be placed at the site, along with vague directions of how to reach the site.</p>\n        <p>Before the group sets off, Enoch informs them he needs some time to think and ponder the next moves in his life with what he has learned of the time skip. He tells them he will try to follow behind their trail, if and when he is able. </p>\n        <p>The group leaves Big Al's farmstead on the morning of the 29th day of the month. Their daytime journey is uneventful, though it features active and spirited discussion of what could be in the offering sack. Bounty of Nonsense seems especially curious about the contents, trying to frame it as just good sense: \"People can take advantage of you if no one is asking questions – I certainly have before!\" Chappy and Nyoma seem highly skeptical, with Chappy remarking, \"Remember when you didn't want to look in those sarcophagi, but this is okay?\" And Nyoma pointing out the religious nature of the offering. At some point, Chappy sneaks a look, seeing the contents to be burnt meat, small wooden carved objects, and trinkets. She keep this information to herself.</p>\n        <p>That night Nyoma has a terrifying experience during her stretch of the watch. On the edge of the bald hill the group is camping on, the tiefling spots a voluminous black shape, a massive and ominous individual wearing something made of billowly cloth almost the size of the tent. A raspy, leaden whisper emanates out of the darker-than-dark fluttering shape on the edge of the firelight - \"What are YOU doing here? This is not... your place...\" Nyoma instantly recognizes this voice, and chokes back a sudden cry. She gathers courage in her voice, and musters her courage to respond, \"You – you took something from me. And I am coming to get it back.\" A long pause, and final grating whisper: \"Then come, and we shall see.\" The figure disappears.</p>\n        <p>Chappy is woken by Nyoma's loud, convulsive sobs. The halfing tries to console the tiefling through what is clearly a mounting panic attack, and in her alarm Chappy calls to Bount to wake as well. Together they try to calm Nyoma down, and when she is once again capable she explains that she encountered this figure once before, that he invaded her mind and made her turn over a priceless volume from the libraries of Candlekeep without her knowledge or agreement. That no one at the hallowed place of knowledge ever seemed to judge her for this, but that she has never been able to forgive herself or the voice for having pried inside of her mind and taken advantaged of her. \"And whoever that was, they are waiting for us.\" The rest of the night passes sleeplessly for all.</p>\n        <p>The next day, on the morning of the 30th, the group encounters the trickling source of Starmetal Creek, and on the other side of the narrow flow of water is a sod hut. The group determines this is where the sack is to be left, but before they can leave it and move on, strange cries and shouts and words seem to echo out from inside. An extremely odd sequence of events leads Nyoma and Chappy to plunge through a curtain at the back of the sod hut, whereupon they interrupt a fight between two bipedal fox-people and one bipedal turtle person over the contents of the sack! Eventually Bount joins them, and the foxes run into the woods, swearing vengeance on the adventurers for aiding the turtlefolk to seize what they seem to call \"the gift.\" One of the foxes flees in a flying cauldron propelled by a broom, while the other runs away and leaves a cauldron behind. As they question the turtle-person, whose name it turns out is Grazig, Chappy claims the cauldron is able to learn how to make it float. Between this and the oversatured extremely vibrant colors of this place, it is obvious the group has come to a very bizarre place.</p>\n        <p>Grazig begs the party to return with him to Turtlehome, where his people live, if not to directly join the turtles' cause against the foxes, then at least to hear out their plea for aid. On the way, Nyoma and Chappy are able to determine the group has come to the Feywild, a mystical domain faerie energies run rampant. There is a hallowed Queen here, and her Prince Consort who apparently was once mortal like the adventurers, and the foxes and the turtles must battle for the possession of the Crystal Unicorn for entrance to a grand feast known quizzically as The Assumption. Grazig brings the party into a mushroom forest to a pond, where turtle-folk ranch salamander mounts, and then escorts them under the pond to a series of oddly angled heavy stone buildings, inside the most ritual-looking of which resides Mother Jusick. As the turtlefolk extract full-sized antler-and-wood weaponry and tools from the sack, Mother Jusick is able to explain further, that turtles and foxes have battled for time immemorial, and that currently the turtles hold the horn of the crystal unicorn while the foxes have stolen the unicorn itself.</p>\n        <p>Bount, underwater and listening to half-sensical war musings from an old turtle woman on a makeshift pedastel, loses his patience. He implores the turtles to try something different for once, to try diplomacy with the foxes, to try something other than creating more \"vanishings,\" using the term by which the turtles seemingly always refer to death. And perhaps surprisingly, Mother Jusick readily agrees to this, and the group finds themselves appointed the diplomatic envoy of the turtlefolk to the foxes' caravan.</p>\n        <p>Grazig, mounted on a fresh moist salamander, leads the party out of the mushroom forest, back to the sod hut, and on to a desert bounded on all sides by trees. In a small desert valley they find a caravan of feather-thatched houses standing on chicken's legs, meandering in the sand. A collection of foxes approach them, including the two they ran off and the foxes' headman, who introduces himself as Fustlum. He is seemingly more self-aware and erudite than Mother Jusich, and in response to questioning he is able to explain that the foxes and turtles exist for the pleasure of the Queen and Prince Consort, that if neither side is victorious, than all are sentenced to vanishing. Despite this, Bount with assistance from Chappy argues vociferously that perhaps the Queen might appreciate a new plot twist, for the foxes and the turtles to come together? As they finish their plea, all four adventurers feel an uncomfortable neck-tingling sense of being watched. But Fustlum turns this over for a few moments, and as with Mother Jusick, comes around to agree with the wisdom of the diplomatic envoys.</p>\n        <p>Some hours later, a large party of turtles – with salamander mounts – has met a coterie of foxes – with chicken-legged houses – at the sod house, to hammer out a peace agreement, with the characters mediating between the two. But before negotiations can begin, a dreadful rumbling is heard in the trees at the edge of the clearing. This is followed by a sudden and raucous fearful quailing from the margins of the crowd of turtles and foxes. \"Oh, no, oh, heavens no!\" Is heard shouted  from one bystander. \"What in the name of the heavens have we done to anger the PRINCE so DREADFULLY?\" screams another. And all at once, the clearing is overrun by a hoard of giant, monstrous, shadowy spiders!</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 11) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>The party tangles with a disgusting eight-legged flood! The great spider swarm seems to be led by a gigantic, grotesque, long sinewy hunter-predator creature that stalks through the crowd slaying the screaming and cowering turtles and foxes. Skittering behind the great black arachnid come two dog-sized spiders as pale as rotten milk with scorpion tails, who sting and sting and sting at corpses which then rise as undead revenants to serve the creatures. The adventurers swallow their disgust, and leap forward to protect their newly-found animalfolk acquaintances. As the battle progresses, Chappy and Bount end up fighting back to back against an enveloping arachnid horde, protecting each other with blade and spell, trying to stay conscious against the many small bites sending venom into their veins. Nyoma is bedeviled by webs flung her way, paralyzing her until a fit of metaphorical and literal incendiary passion sees the tiefling warlock burst into a coruscating halo of red and green flame. She strikes and burns and melts a succession of many-legged creatures to protect a gathering crowd of animalfolk at the sod hut. And Pandjed carves his own way through the arachnid mess, bringing his heavy warhammer down over and over in crushing blows that explode spiders and splash their inner gore outward to mark the Feywild soil.</p>\n        <p>The largest, bulbous, dark-bodied creature falls after a desperate struggle, bleeding and leaking black shadow-stuff instead of blood. But when it dies, an explosion of confetti appears? And on the ground, a crisp bone-ivory envelope of fine make. After the adventurers at last wipe the rest of the spider swarm from the land, they are able to finally breathe and the Dragonborn paladin picks up the envelope. Inside is delicate parchment, which reads:</p>\n        <img src=\"./images/session_11_invitation.jpg\" className=\"session-img img-shadow\" alt=\"Session 11 Invitation\" />\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 12) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Immediately after the pitched battle with the strange arachnids, Bounty of Nonsense is engulfed in a sudden white-hot light, and finds himself face to face with the mysterious shadowy figure that previously accosted Nyoma, while his companions perceive only that he has fallen unconscious. Later that evening, after a rest, the entire group finds themselves dressed to the nines and being feted at the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, part of a swirling mad revelry of strange beasts, faeries, and monsters with backdrops seemingly plucked from their own memories. They trade barbs with the Fae Royal Seneschal, attempt to curry favor with the Fire Giant Ambassador using Pandjet's stoic demeanor, and endure a frightful audience with her Royal Majesty herself. Chappy almost loses herself in the thrumming crowd comprising a Neverwinter street festival on a wide bridge swathed in paper lights and festival stalls. Pandjet resists an eerie call from what he concludes to be a foul imitation of a temple of Savras in a secret grove from his childhood. Nyoma is initially slightly enchanted by a dream-like multiplications of giant plush beds on a vastly-stretching balcony, only to be disturbed by the strangeness and inexplicable urgency of the ever-swelling gigantic moon hanging in the night sky. All of the adventurers feel threatened by the madness of the Queen's castle, whatever form it takes, and Chappy tries to convince her friends that this place steals parts of those who come here.</p>\n        <p>Despite the looming threat surrounding them, the four begin to piece together a number of puzzle pieces. The shadowy figure, the voice from Nyoma's past, the Prince, and the Black Spider are one and the same, and in fact they are able to place a true name to him: Nezznar of Gwynneth. Nezznar was once mortal, but something has transformed him in some fundamental way, and the Queen now treats him as a powerful but captive plaything for her amusement. He is engaged in some kind of treachery against the Queen in The Assumption Of Breath Stolen From The Mother In Anticipation Of Doom Yet To Come, the ritual whereby the Queen seems to take yearly power from the Moon. It becomes apparent that the Prince has agents trying to curry support and favor from the guests of the Assumption while he waits in the Observatory Tower for the midnight climax of the celebration.</p>\n        <p>But the Queen also seems terrifying, callous, and mercurial, with her moods running like water and the only constant being her complete arrogance and lack of anything approaching human morality. She reveals that the frogs and foxes were both created as a diversion to ward off boredom, and in fact ends their existences entirely to attempt to demonstrate their unreal nature to Nyoma and the others. She explains that the party was invited because of the possibility that they might be marginally more entertaining than her former playthings, and she tasks the group with rooting out the traitors and spies in her midst, with subtle threats of punishment for any who don't comply with this particular game.</p>\n        <p>Trying to understand the shifting political sands beneath them, the group debates how to steer between the black-spider-shaped rock and the malevolent temperamental hard place they now find themselves between. Even Nyoma, despite her almost-total revulsion, agrees that as they have spoken to the Queen, they might as well hear what the Prince has to say. And so they seek out the Prince's mannequin servitors, their featureless faces scabbed over with black rotgrowth, and are directed up the seemingly endless stairs to the observatory tower. At last, they find themselves at the top, paradoxically in the lower hold of a ship called The Low Lantern, where Bount wiled away many hours of youth playing Applehead. A dirty, dingy sailcloth has been hung in the middle of the deck, dividing the space in two. Behind the cloth waits a great mysterious figure, cast upon the barrier in shadow by lamplight. It beckons the adventurers forward.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 13) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>The adventurers gird themselves to at last face their heretofore unknown antagonist, the Black Spider, pausing on the precipice of a dreamlike scene from Bounty of Nonsense's past. But before they can step forward to the dirty sailcloth, in a moment they are collectively whisked away to an altogether different space. Space being meant literally, since they find themselves seemingly standing in an all-encompassing starscape. And there they encounter the moon goddess Selune, or at least one who claims to be Selune, as the skeptical Pandjed muses. But Nyoma feels at home here, and Selune embraces her comfortingly. They share warm words, and the goddess greets each of the adventurers in turn: Chappy, who responds with wide-eyed awe; Bount, who continues to be full of questions; and Pandjed, who holds himself cautious and reserved, not liking this experience (\"Just like your patron,\" Selune comments with a smile). Though their time in that place is short, Nyoma is able to confess her fears and uncertainty, and Selune counsels her to trust herself and her friends. The moon goddess explains she is here to \"break the narrative,\" to try and step outside of the stories the Fae and those who live with them are bound to replicate. She urges them to step out of the narrative as well, for only by doing so can they possibly hope to escape. But before she can explain much more, with just a few last words of the power that can conferred from the moon in its current ebullient state here in the Feywild, the adventurers are drawn back to the Low Lantern, their confrontation waiting.</p>\n        <p>The sailcloth draws away, and the group has only moments to try and decompress from their time with Selune before they are met by a very tall, thin, and gaunt high elf wearing regal black, white, and gold. He is sitting at a broad table with a crystal goblet of wine, and he invites them to join him. His language is precise though his voice sounds ragged and stretched thin, and he introduces himself as Nezznar. Chappy sits, but the rest remain cautiously standing around the table. What follows is a long, expansive, and tense verbal sparring session, with each side shifting between questions, accusations, arguments, and hesitant bargaining. Chappy and Bount engage the most directly, trying to understand as much as possible about Nezznar, the current situation, and everything. Pandjed fixes the Black Spider with a piercing cold stare throughout the conversation, speaking up to emphasize moral points or question vagueness on the Prince's part. Meanwhile, Nyoma can only barely hide her deep contempt, and is unable to resist the occasional biting remark.</p> \n        <p>Throughout this conversation, the adventurers learn much of the Spider's plans. He intends to slay the Queen with a dagger of cold iron at the moment before the Assumption. But he needs someone who the Queen would not expect and could not predict to actually plunge the dagger in the moment, and this means someone not of the Feywild. He proposes the adventurers take on this task, while he distracts her with a show of open aggression. The Prince also makes a mysterious comment about the Feywild and its transformative properties, with a subtle but knowing reference to Bounty of Nonsense. This prompts Bount and then the others to be able to \"see\" a flickering, flashing ring of fire enveloping the tabaxi's heart, leaving him confused and afraid. Chappy puts a hand on Bount's shoulder, and tries to be lightly reassuring, \"Sorry Bount, you're magic too now...\" </p> \n        <p>But perhaps most importantly of all, Nezznar is drawn into explaining his aims for the Forge of Spells. He explains he is a prisoner in the Feywild, and that when the Queen grew bored of him as a mortal lover, she began to descend into cruelly whimsical experiments \"loosing the bonds of the morphic fields that tie me to any particular shape.\" This is punctuated by a worrying upswell and undulating disturbance underneath the fabric of his fine black coat. He further says, \"Sometimes, it was used as a horrific kind of punishment, twisting me this way or that to teach me a punitive lesson.\" After a pause: \"I once spent several years as furniture.\" And so, Nezznar tells the four that he believes the Forge to be an instrument of pure creation, a device that can rework the outlines of reality. And he intends to use it to destroy the concept of magic, to recreate the world in a form \"without such cruel power as can be used to corrupt the very soul of a living being.\" For the briefest fraction of a moment, Bount and possibly even Chappy seem to consider this seriously, before Nyoma launches in with a strenuous counterargument. In the end, the conversation drifts back to the topic at hand: the assassination of the Queen.</p> \n        <p>At least, and perhaps as one might expect for a place such as the Feywild, the adventurers are presented with a contract of treachery, putting them on the line to aid Nezznar. Specifically, the contract's enforcement requires that all signatories take no direct action to harm each other in the Feywild from midnight tonight to three days hence, with the special assurance that after the deed is complete they adventurers will be permitted to leave and return to the material plane in peace, unharassed for the same three days. As an additional incentive, Nezznar offers to let the adventurers in on two secrets: the locations of the Forge of Spells and where the last key is located. After heated discussion back and forth, Chappy opts to sign, and so does Bount (albeit under magical mental influence from Chappy, after an elaborate series of winks and nudges and subtle hints between the two). Pandjed and Nyoma cannot bring themselves to. The Black Spider declares himself satisfied with this arrangement, and additionally he subtly entreats and/or threatens Pandjed and Nyoma that he will not harm them if they do not do the same - or alternately, it is understood that he will surely harm them in the reverse case. He then shares the location of the Forge – oddly enough, just a day's hike to the east of Phandalin. Also, the last key is supposedly held by a dragon who haunts the ruins of Thundertree to the east of Neverwinter wood.</p> \n        <p>Yet midnight approaches, and after Nezznar hands the cold-iron dagger over to Bount, the group nods a silent farewell to the Prince before descending the stairs. They have an appointment to keep.</p>     \n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 14) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Bounty of Nonsense, Nyoma Izarren, Prexijandilin Pandjet, and Chappy Quickstep have but moments to prepare, the crowd drawing them down the stairs and toward the main hall. Just before they enter, Bount spares a moment and draws the mask from a pouch. He places it on, and casts his thoughts toward the Prince. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he feels incredible hatred, images of violence toward the Queen. But in the snapshot roulette of images is also a bird's eye view down on Phandalin, and something that resembles a gigantic version of the upright artifact-construct coffin the adventurers encountered in the Shrine of Savras. Unable to take more than a moment or two of such pure hatred, Bount yanks the mask off, shivering.</p>\n        <p>Entering the main hall, the group discovers it has become a bleak crest rising from a hilltop, with a twisting narrow cliff-path leading to an upraised ruin of a tower where the throne would have other been. In the place of the throne, there is now an oblong dark stone altar, stained with reds and browns and blacks. The Queen and her closest courtiers are arrayed there. One of those courtiers passes the group, and implores them to join him up on the ruined tower, \"as retainers of the Queen you are now, no?\" They approach, but Pandjet hangs back just outside the steps up to the tower floor, on the clifftop path. Nyoma and Bount arrange themselves on opposite sides of the Queen. Chappy tries to lose herself in the group thronging the Faerie Queen, and then subtly plucks the chords to dissolve herself into invisibility.</p>\n        <p>After a few more moments of tense waiting, the ritual begins, with the Seneschal intoning a dense and interweaving series of arcane chant, consonants nearly cut with arcane power. The Queen kneels, in anticipation of the robbery of force and majesty about to be enacted on the moon. Pandjet casts repeated glances back toward the entrance to the hall – somehow still present despite the outside surroundings – unsure exactly when Nezznar of Gwynneth would choose to make his appearance. </p>\n        <p>But he does not get a chance to find out. As the Seneschal speaks of the Queen's mastery over the tides and time of the moon, Nyoma loses her patience. She suddenly mounts the pedestal surrounding the altar, and explodes in indignation at the Queen. \"The moon – Selune! – gives light and power to everyone who seeks it freely! It's not to be stolen by monsters like you!\" Everything stops for a moment. The Queen looks up, and then stands up. She prepares to gloat, her face twisting into a mocking, laughing smile. She is interrupted by Bounty of Nonsense plunging the cold iron dagger right between her shoulder blades. </p>\n        <p>Everything is chaos. The courtiers stampede, as Her Royal Highness slumps and falls to the ground, dagger still buried in her back. The Queen's guards advance on the adventurers, and it is now the Nezznar chooses to make his appearance. From the main entrance, he screams, \"Seize them! They have felled our Royal Majesty and must be brought low!\" An extended, bloody melee ensues. Pandjet, Chappy, Bount, and Nyoma are surrounded on all sides by the Queen's guards, while the Prince's retainers advance up the clifftop path, lobbing spells and arrows toward the group on the ruined tower. Chappy launches Pandjet into the air with the power of flight, turning the dragonborn into a soaring instrument of destruction. Pandjet privately rejoices to once more be Savras' hand of fate.</p>\n        <p>As the Prince advances, he tries to rally the crowd against the \"interlopers\" - but a gigantic flame sphere he summons from nothing also happens to mysteriously go awry and immolate the Queen's restless body. Nothing but ashes remain. The battle continues. At some point, Nyoma grabs the dagger from the ash pile. Pandjet fights his way through the crowd until he is side by side with the Fire Giant General, who seems stunned by the fight taking place all around him. With difficulty, the paladin is able to break through to gain the General's attention. He points at the tower and says, \"The magical flame on the Queen!\" He then points at the General's ice-encased hands. Finally roused from his stupor, the giant slowly nods, and begins lumbering toward the flame. Within moments, he is free, and ready to fight on the side of the adventurers.</p>\n        <p>When the vanguard of the Prince's forces reach Bount, the first of the group, a fae knight engages the tabaxi in swordplay but mutters sotto voce: \"Surrender. There was an agreement.\" Bount makes a show he saying he would play the surrender up \"real good,\" and engages in a large amount of dramatics before he – and shortly afterwards his companions – lay down their weapons. Nezznar and his forces do as well. The two sides approach each other to parlay.</p>\n        <p>But yet again, the tiefling warlock intercedes. When Nezznar is distracted by a comment from Chappy, Nyoma sidles up and stabs the cold-iron dagger right into his side! The Prince turns, eyes aflame with rage and shock. \"You don't even know what you've done,\" he moans. And suddenly, the bespoke black royal garments explode away from Nezznar's back, as the lower two-thirds of a massive spider's thorax and abdomen explode outwards from his body. Eight oily black legs extend to the ground and the spider-bulk lifts the Prince's body, clothed in tatters, with Nezznar's legs hanging helplessly off of the spider frame supporting it. But his body is upright, with his face is incandescent with fury.</p>\n        <p>Nyoma and the others beat a panicked retreat to the middle of the altar pedastel, trying to cope with what they've seen and put some plan into motion to deal with it. But before any can be suggested, the air suddenly congeals. Nezznar's voice is carried across the distance, carrying a grating syncopated rhythm of broken speech, arcane syllables twisted by hatred and malice. Once more, a sphere of flame is launched directly toward the altar, engulfing the tower. The four adventurers leap, duck, and dodge, and manage to avoid the worst of it. But before the flames even completely clear, a dark and frozen wind envelopes the area. The evacuating heat of the flames tussles with the bone-chilling reach of the sudden storm being whipped up. Knife-sized and sword-sharp chunks of ice strike the ground, and the ruined tower walls, coming from all directions. </p>\n        <p>The foursome is unable to evade this assault. Chappy hunkers down and tries to withstand the onslaught, as with so many things before, but it is not long before she crumples into a sad, little ball. Pandjet mutters, \"Not again,\" to the world at large, before he too falls. Bount looks at all of his companions - It's funny, he thinks, to finally find friends in this life, only to have them taken so soon. \"For once, I thought I had something to protect,\" is the last thought he has before he loses consciousness. And Nyoma, seeing all of this destruction around her, sheds a single tear. She sends up one last prayer to Selune: \"I'm sorry. I just wanted to defend you, and what was stolen from both of us.\" Then the darkness closes in on her as well.</p>\n        <p>Time passes.</p>\n        <p>This is not the end. The adventurers find themselves in a rude two-wheeled wooden cart. All four of them. After the initial shock fades, Nyoma begins openly weeping and apologizing to the others. Bount expresses shock and a complete lack of understanding. Chappy is the first to begin grasping what happened, because she looks over at Nyoma and shouts, \"What about the TRIANGLES?!\" Nyoma is able to find a pouch, in which the many-shaped polyhedrons are still placed. Pandjet is... quiet in his reflection. Chappy waves off Nyoma, who continues to apologize profusely, with a quippy, \"That's just how it goes when you're an adventurer!\" But the halfling is unable to light the cigarette she grabbed from her tobacco pouch, her hands entirely too shaky.</p>\n        <p>At length, the group notices the nearby fire being tended by the Fire Giant Ambassador! He introduces himself as Lyuth, finally having remembered his own name, and explains they are safe. Apparently, the ice storm wiped out most of the Prince's retainers, \"and something TOOK the Prince as well. I couldn't begin to say what, except that it was big. And dark.\" Nyoma continues her apology tour by apologizing to Lyuth, while Bount hails the Fire Giant as their hero and a lifesaver. \"Well, it was the least I could do for you who gave me back my hands!\" He says, triumphantly raising his hands out of the coals of the fire in which they were previously comfortably nestled.</p>\n        <p>The stars shine down, normal not-Faerie stars, casting their light upon the barren tops of the Starmetal Hills of the real, actual world.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 15) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>[Interlude scene, before the events of the session: Lyuth beckons Nyoma over to a collection of makeshift equipment he has set up by the fire – normal sized to the giant, but bonfire-sized to her and her companions. He leans all the way down to the ground, rummaging among some gear, before coming partway up, his head at the same level as the tiefling's. \"I took the liberty upon myself.\" He hands over a long, thin package, small in giant-sized hands but over five feet in length. He smiles wryly: \"My people are crafters, do you know this? I could not resist such a tempting challenge. Rechristened, it is Aurvan, and it is part of the repayment of my debt.\" Inside is Iarno Albrek's once sundered staff, now whole again. The repaired staff is a polished mix of white and gray materials. The clear glass sphere that once sat at the top has been replaced by dark swirling blue-black glass, in the depths of which twinkling lights like miniature stars can be glimpsed.]</p>\n        <p><i>Two days after coming back to the world... </i></p>\n        <p>\"I don't want to die,\" Chappy announces bitterly, staring into Lyuth's bonfire-sized campfire. The others are shocked out of similar distant stares and turn toward the normally quippy halfling. Nyoma and Bount try to raise her spirits, but nothing they try works. \"Well, you know, you wanted to write a great tale,\" Bount hesitates, \"We want you to here, to be part of our story. But if that's not where your story leads – and that's fine, okay, we understand – but what story is next for you?\" Chappy just looks away. \"Who cares? What does it matter?\" The group sits for several long moments in sad silence. \"I think I'm going to head to the Ranch.\" Pandjed looks over at Chappy, and slowly nods. He reaches into a pouch at his belt, and rummages around. Eventually, he produces a crumpled ball of paper, which he unfurls. Reaching back into the pouch to grab an ink nib, the dragonborn signs the bottom of the piece of paper. \"I hereby grant you the rights to use my likeness.\" Nyoma takes the paper next and also signs it, adding, \"You can feel free to use a bit of artistic license with me, if you like.\" She then hands the contract form to Chappy, who tries to be as gracious as possible as she accepts it.</p>\n        <p>Chappy Quickstep departs the next morning.</p>\n        <p><i>One day further on... </i></p>\n        <p>The group – now just the three plus Lyuth – sits around the bonfire, planning and processing in equal measure. For the planning, they briefly debate taking the river through Neverwinter Wood to reach Thundertree, before Pandjed announces his god Savras feels this is an ill-omened decision. For the processing, Lyuth tries to encourage them through the only lens he knows, that of crafting, speaking of the greater solidity of things once broken and later mended. The fire giant also lets drop that for the last week, someone has been watching them. This causes a light panic, which grows as a stranger steps out of the shadows at the base of the hill and hails them sprightly. Pandjed, Nyoma, and Bount all rise and draw weapons, but the figure approaches seemingly absent any cares toward the hostility. She is a vaguely elfin woman with long white hair, twinkling with minute ice crystals intertwined, wearing a hodgepodge of woven-together shells and scales as armor along with decorated flowing blue and white fabrics and with a sword carved from an antler scabbered at her side. She introduces herself as Wayez, still standing at quite a distance.</p>\n        <p>Wayez is an odd one, and she tells an odd tale. A tale of a mote of ice in the Feywild that \"became a person, and did the things that people do, like running about, and singing to itself, and eating a raw seal.\" (\"Seal?\" Bount erupts incredulously. Nyoma: \"I've had seal before, it's not bad.\" Lyuth: \"Yes, there is much meat on seals!\" Bount blanches.) The mote of ice was summoned to court by the Queen of Ice and Darkness, whereupon it became a faerie Knight Errant who loved her Queen dearly. And so, when the Queen died, the Knight Errant set out to slay those who slaughtered Her Majesty. But upon leaving the Feywild, the Knight Errant once again became a person, and found that was to her liking. \"So,\" Wayez concludes, \"I have come to propose an exchange of services. I know many things and have many skills, and could be of much use to you.\"</p>\n        <p>This is unsurprisingly met with some skepticism. \"Um, no offense, but how do we know you won't just kill us in our sleep?\" Bount checks in. Wayez responds chipperly, \"Oh, yes, I could have easily murdered you while you slept! But I didn't!\" Again, this does not ease tensions. Pandjed says, \"You say you have skills? What kinds of skills?\" Wayez: \"I have much knowledge of treaties with the spirits of your world, and I am deadly in a fight besides.\" Without missing a beat, Pandjed sweeps up a javelin from his pack and launches it directly at the Faerie, but Wayez fluidly sidesteps out of the way. The paladin grunts approval.</p>\n        <p>Nyoma weighs in, \"You know, we are not even sure exactly what we want to do next. You've seen the Prince up close, and you saw what he did to us, I assume? We're even thinking it might be best to just run.\" Wayez mulls this over for a moment, before responding, \"I think to run away is to have what is before, to be made into something you are not. I think that is not the way.\" Nyoma: \"Well, okay, but did you know he also has control of a dragon?\" \"Yes, I do! I have never seen a dragon, and do not know quite what one is. Nonetheless, this 'dragon' intrigues me. I feel it is kind of like myself – it has become something that it is not meant to be, and it should instead be what it should be.\" She points to one particular green scale on her armor: \"Also, this one part of my garb allows me to pinpoint the locations of dragons! As you can see, I will be quite useful.\" After some more back and forth, no conclusion on whether Wayez shall join has been reached, and the conversation reaches a natural pause. The tabaxi turns to the dragonborn and says, \"So, Pandjed, what do you think?\" Pandjed puts a hand to his scaly chin: \"I think... we will probably travel tomorrow.\"</p>\n        <p>The next morning, bitterly cold and with a piercing wind. Winter has burst into full bloom. The new group of four prepares to leave. Nyoma says a heartfelt goodbye and many thanks to Lyuth, who plans to head north to the homehalls of the Fire Giants. He thanks her in turn, and invites her and her companions as honored guests if they are ever to pass by that way. After this, everyone packs up their things, and assembles their best impromptu attempt at cold-weather gear. Nyoma is still wearing her traveling gear, with her sleeping blanket around her shoulders. Bount is wearing the extremely fancy suit he picked up in the Feywild, and another fancy suit he had on him, and the red cloak of the redcloaks, and many things besides. Pandjed and Wayez both seem generally unbothered by the weather. They set off south, cutting just around the Kalazorn Ranch and heading toward Phandalin over a three day trip.</p>\n        <p>It is an opportunity for the others to get to know Wayez. She continues to be eccentric, addressing Nyoma, Pandjed, and Bount as Moonspeaker, Thunderfoot, and Brightheart respectively. At one point, Bount inquires whether Wayez has such an evocative nickname for herself. In response, Wayez covers her mouth and giggles uncontrollably. Wayez also claims to be in control of certain treaties with the roads and paths of this world so as to make them travel lighter and faster than they would otherwise. After two days have passed, Nyoma privately notices that they seem to be traveling about as quickly as when they headed out this way to start with? She turns this over in her head, but eventually concludes that at least they're not going any slower! During the night watch on one evening, Nyoma makes sure to find time to commune with Selune, decompressing over all that has happened to her, trying to make sense of everything, but also communicating gratitude for her somehow ending up safe after all of this thus far.</p>\n        <p>As they hike, the tiefling warlock occasionally places her hand on Pandjed's shoulder and follows him blindly, checking the region around their path through the eyes of her owl-familiar Kevin. At one point along the way, Kevin comes to encounter a curious site: a large scar in the forest north of the path, with broken bushes and demolished trees encased in ice covering the earth. A herd of deer, or the chunked icy remains of a herd, occupy the center of the scar. Nyoma announces this to the group, and says, \"It has to be the dragon, right?\" In response to this, Wayez bounds over to a nearby bush, where a small songbird is perched. She leans down and converses quietly with the bird, who nervously informs Wayez that both the bird and she are late for the Big Migration, for the Great Predator has predated upon the large ones here! Wayez shows much concern, and asks the bird from where came the Great Predator, and the bird, chirping in terror, indicates \"the Singular Stone Tree Where No Smallbird Must Go!\" At this, the bird is too spooked to continue the conversation, and flies away. Wayez returns to the group. \"Yes! It was the dragon. It seems to lair on the peak to the south,\" as she points toward Icespire Peak rising up from the Sword Mountains. The four leave this place, with great haste, but noting the knowledge for the future.</p>\n        <p>Just a day out from Phandalin, the group encounters a hastily erected wooden signpost. It carries a copy of the solicitation for help in dragon slaying (with pardons!) that the party saw previously, but also a quite realistically-drawn portrait of Bounty of Nonsense above the words, \"WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE.\" Below this is a long list of crimes, including confidence scams, fraud, robbery of good and noble folk, so on and so forth. It is stamped with the same emblem of the Flaming Fist as is present on the solicitation. Wayez strides up to the wanted poster, pulls out a quill, and adds \"QUEEN KILLING\" to the list. Bount does not seem amused, but the faerie nods in satisfaction.</p>\n        <p>Studying the wanted poster and the solicitation, Nyoma says, \"You know, Bount, pardons are being offered here. Maybe the Flaming Fist could actually help us somehow?\" Bount: \"Excuse me? You want to turn me in? I feel like it's pretty obvious there the alive is only temporary, until they feel like killing me themselves!\" Nyoma: \"No, no! Obviously, I don't want to turn you in, or like, crimp your style, or really affect you poorly. Like, I mean, I guess I have... oh, wow. I've been a terrible friend to all of you!\" Bount: \"No, that's not true.. in any case, good and noble? More like awful and dickish, but of course they don't use that type of language. But you all know me, all of my schemes are confident! What's wrong with that?\" The group ponders this, before Nyoma slowly asks, \"Wait a second. Bount, why do you always bring up the Flaming Fist if THEY'RE the ones hunting YOU?\"</p>\n        <p>Bounty of Nonsense stammers for a moment, before collecting himself. \"Listen. I do have a history with this group, more than you know. But please, you can't listen to what is on this sheet. The person described on this sheet is someone who gets drunk, bets too much, does hits and schemes, and then cuts and runs away from old partners with new friends. The person who is shown in this poster does not stick to his word. But I do stick to my word now. The person from this poster hands you gold in one hand, and the sharp end of a blade in the other. That's not me. Not anymore. I can't give you more specifics, but trust me on this.\" The others quietly accept this for now, and no more is said.</p>\n        <p>They proceed toward Phandalin, discussing what if anything to do about the wanted poster. Pandjed, quite pleased with himself, suggests that Bount wears the mind-reading mask to hide his face. The tabaxi shrugs that suggestion off without much consideration. Anyway, it's night, and so they cut across fields for the last mile to approach the town from an oblique angle, which will put them into the middle of town without following the usual roads in. Even from a distance, it's clear Phandalin seems different. There are more lights on the streets at night, and the folk about seem of a more varied, mercenary, and rough-and-tumble sort. But the group does not have much time to remark on this. Instead, their attention is drawn to a squat dwarf or halfling-sized cottage with a human-sized market stall hastily built onto the cottage front. Above the stall is a large but cheap-looking signboard, which has been painted with whitewash as an advertisement. It declares: \"CLASH ENTERPRISES, GOODS AND SUNDRIES FOR ONE AND ALL.\" It is accentuated by a cartoonish painting of a toothy smiling goblin face.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 16) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Bounty of Nonsense, Wayez, Nyoma, and Pandjed make contact with Clash in Phandalin, and come to realize the town is now much different than the dustry frontier mining town they left behind due to mob and flaming torch reasons. Along with the prospectors and traders that were previously present, the pop-up town is now also filled with a diverse menagerie of rough and capable sorts wielding weapons and decorated in strange esoteric fashions of many kinds, representing all manner of folks, cultures, and sizes. Adventurers, in other words!</p>\n        <p>Over a drink at the Stonehill Inn, once sleepy but now boasting benches sagging with halflings to hobgoblins shouting and drinking and throwing dice, Clash notes the wounded look that Nyoma, Pandjed, and Bount all carry with them in turn, and she seems shocked and concerned. It seems she took the return of the group as expected or even a foregone conclusion, and seeing how the trip to the Feywild shook them braces her. She also expresses sincere sadness at not having been able to wish Chappy a goodbye. But on the urging of Bount and the others, she fills them in on what has happened in their absence, first to her and then to Phandalin. </p>\n        <p>As suggested, Clash left the sod hut in the Starmetal Hills after two days, making her way to Big Al's Farmstead for a momentary rest, and then traveling on back to Phandalin to await (as she presumed) the eventual return of the others. As she dutifully informs Bounty of Nonsense, she also ensured that she mailed his letter posthaste, and so both of his letters have now been posted. (Bount is very secretive with the others as to what those letters might have contained.) The goblin, initially in possession of a donkey and some goods purchased from Big Al's incipient village, managed to make some lucky trades and in short time was the leasor of her own market stall, with attached house! Also surprisingly, Clash managed to locate Gundren Rockseeker - who seemed to be suffering from some kind of afflicition or trauma that left him broken and unbalanced - but Clash kept him safe and housed as her impromptu roommate. </p>\n        <p>Upon arriving back in Phandalin, Clash found that the town was now under the management of the Flaming Fist mercenary company, brought in at the request of the mining company director to kill the dragon causing such alarm and fear among the locals. With the Flaming Fist came handbills advertising for hired work in the dragon-hunting entourage, and so along came the adventurers as well, and the famous Rose Knight of Neverwinter to lead the cavalcade. But seemingly all of a sudden, the leader of the Flaming Fist took their forces out of Phandalin and marched on Cragmaw Castle. (Bount admits that maybe one of his letters had a little something to do with this turn of events.) A battle of some kind ensued, but no one is exactly sure who would have won, because a scaly monstrous beast fell out of the sky to decimate both sides. And now the straggling remnants of both the Flaming Fist and the Cragmaw Auxiliary have returned to the area, with the Fist still exerting nominal control over the town but largely remaining outside of town in their own camp, only returning intermittently to oversee the \"auditions\" the Rose Knight holds in a large tent in town, granting adventurers entry to the dragon hunt. </p>\n        <p>Bounty of Nonsense prods Clash for more information about the Flaming Fist. He learns that the Fist in town is led by a mean, violent thug that smells of cabbage, who Clash thinks is called Griff. And this knowledge seems to stun the tabaxi into silence. Eventually, over a few more drinks, Bount spills his guts about his history with the Flaming Fist. Though presenting themselves as a force for justice, there are monsters inside, he explains. When Bount was a child, this Griff brutalized his family, and beat Bount's father so badly he lost sight in one eye. And, Bount explains, he has seen them do that and worse to so many others. So Bounty of Nonsense, gifted with a quick tongue and clever sensibilities, and also a signet ring he happened to somehow fall into the possession of, began a long-term campaign to tar the name of the Flaming Fist. He would travel from place to place, pretending to be a member of the mercenary company, cheating or stealing or betraying people in the name of the Fist. I was lying to show the truth, he explains, so that they could see the Fist for the monsters they truly are underneath the story they tell the world. Nyoma asks Bount what he wants to do next here. The tabaxi remains silent, with an uncertain look on his face. He then makes a polite excuse, and stands up from the table, taking a room at the Inn and leaving the others to wind down the night. </p>\n        <p>The next morning, the group discusses where to head next. There is general agreement that they need supplies, and Nyoma notes she is in dire need of winter traveling clothes. As part of the shopping, Clash gives them an odd item she had stored away for their purposes, a glass flask which the goblin proudly terms Bottled Applause. Nyoma is also careful to reach out her senses to detect tendrils of magic in Clash's accumulated wares. She turns up a few potions, and also something else? It is confusing. But after the shopping and all that, there is discussion of whether they should go ahead and head out of town for Thundertree, to get a headstart on the dragon hunters. At first, this seems to be the plan. But then Pandjed speaks up, \"Wait. I believe… we should talk to Gundren.\" And as if often the case when the normally taciturn Pandjed voices a course of action, the group listens. </p>\n        <p>The interaction with Gundren at Clash's cottage is uncomfortable and strange. The older dwarf seems irrational, paranoid, and quick to anger. On multiple occasions, he accuses first Pandjed and then Nyoma of reading his thoughts and prying into his brain. Bounty of Nonsense leans down close to the dwarf, and this seems to set him off for the final time, and he bumrushes the others - including Clash - right out of the door, shouting about their spying, their watching of him and listening to him, and how he tolerate enemies and traitors no longer! Nyoma begins to wonder aloud what has happened to the old prospector, but before she gets too deep in rumination, Bounty of Nonsense practically drags her and the others away from the area. The tabaxi explains Gundren has been compromised, with a minute amount of black mold sludge visible on careful examination in the dwarf's ear canal. Nothing said around Gundren is safe anymore, Bounty says. Wayez's eyes go glassy and she sways in place for just a moment. When she comes back, she adds with total confidence that Clash is certainly in danger if they do not do something about this, and soon.</p>\n        <p>--</p>\n        <p>Favorite quote not otherwise included: Wayez, matter of factly - \"Yes, Brightheart has many incomprehensible schemes! It is why he is such a great villain.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 17) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>The Flaming Fist enter Phandalin, making a circuit around the town, pushing passers-by aside to make way for the small posse. At the head of the posse is stout middle-aged human with a short, carefully pointed white beard. He is a foot shorter than most of the Fist soldiers, except for the wide-brimmed feather-adorned cap he wears. A dwarven child that does not move quickly enough out of the way of the group receives a solid kick to the head, and at a head nod from the leader, a pair of soldiers turn to seize and roughly question a tabaxi woman. </p>\n        <p>The adventurers watch this from the roof and the second story of the abandoned Snout and Truffle mining company headquarters, taking advantage of the elevation to get a good look at the Flaming Fist mercenaries. Well, except for Wayez, who threads through the legs of townspeople as a cat, getting a close-up look. \"That's Griff,\" growls Bounty of Nonsense. \"Hopefully you can see that I may tell tall tales, but this is the truth.\" After a slow circle through the dusty town, the soldiers follow the overall movement of the crowd and head toward the big tent. Pandjed and co. decide to do the same, leaving the question of Gundren for slightly later. It has begun to snow, a light flurry drifiting from the thick clouds above.</p>\n        <p>Outside the tent people gather in small groups, talking nervously or buying fried foods or beer from pair of wandering vendors. Inside, a good portion of the town is arrayed on some hastily erected raised benches. The atmosphere is halfway between a carnival and a judicial trial, and the nervousness is palpable. \"This reminds me of home!\" Wayez observes chipperly. The Flaming Fist have spread out to take over two sets of benches, near to the second tent opening, on the far side of the oval structure from the entrance. </p>\n        <p>The show starts with a spotlight center tent. Into it strides a very tall woman in early middle age, with black hair streaked with gray, girded with immaculate plate mail exquisitely lacquered in green with embossed red roses. She introduces herself dramatically as the Rose Knight Melalonde Rechuviel, and begins a speech about heroism and bravery and skill, and how all that and more will be required to slay such a terrible foe as a dragon. Suddenly, Nyoma stirs: \"I… know this! I recognize those lines.\" The others look over with confusion as Nyoma more or less repeats the Rose Knight's dialog, line for line. \"It's one of the Waterdhavian classics, this was my favorite play when I was a little girl!\" She pauses. \"Plus, look at her armor - not a scratch or a dent on it. This is all so dramatic. Maybe the Rose Knight isn't actually as skilled at hunting dragons as she's supposed to be?\"</p>\n        <p>Yet, the show goes on. After the speech, the Rose Knight withdraws, and one by one, members of the crowd stand and audition to join the dragon hunt. The first petitioner introduces himself as Azubuike Quanda, and he puts on an excellently skilled demonstration of agility, juggling, and precision with the help of two wizards producing timed and shaped fire blasts. His performance receives cheers, and a slow clap from Pandjed. The Rose Knight folds her arms across her chest, and declares herself unimpressed. This receives boos, including very enthusiastic booing from Wayez. Regardless, this same pattern plays out as several more try their hand, all with varying impressive degrees of skill with combat, magic, or more esoteric talents, but the Rose Knight denies them all. After the fourth failure, Griff - who has been silently stewing - explodes and rushes the Rose Knight, stabbing a stubby finger into the torso of her armor. He spits and swears and tantrums, with filthy insults and a menacing tone. He demands to know why so many capable auditioners have been denied, when they so badly need help to slay the dragon. </p>\n        <p>Bounty of Nonsense uses this opportunity to step into the situation, cutting Griff off mid-rant. He begins his speech: \"But it is not the dragon they are to fight, it is the corruption.\" He thanks the Rose Knight for her stewardship, bowing to her, and appears to recognize the Flaming Fist similarly, before pivoting to lambast the mercenary company as villains, thugs, cruel monsters all. Griff tries to interrupt him once, but Bount swiftly and skillfully silences him with further allegations, and finally admits that HE was the one who sent the letter that led the Fist to Cragmaw Castle and to their doom! At this, Griff explodes once more: \"You… motherfucker. You son of an alley cat whore. I don't know if you're telling the truth, but either way I hope you're prepared for us to knock every fucking tooth of our fucking head!\" But before the mercenary can rush him, Bount implores the Rose Knight to hear him out, under the pardon provision of the handbills. Rechuviel nods, and places her hand on Griff Irongut's chest to stay him from advancing, with all the confidence of born nobility.  She beckons Bount to countinue. </p>\n        <p>He lays a challenge on Griff, for one-on-one combat, to serve as his audition. And if Bount wins, then he will go to the Flaming Fist's justice. For a reward, he simply asks for any and all help available to his companions as THEY hunt the dragon, for they have a high and just mission to carry out, of which the dragon is only one part. The Rose Knight thinks this over for a few moments, and agrees. To appease the Flaming Fist, she produces one additional stipulation: Bounty of Nonsense must agree to be taken into custody by the mercenaries for the night. The duel will take place the following day at noon. The soldiers take custody of Bount, and lead him away. The other adventurers are shocked and stunned. Clash seems outraged. </p>\n        <p>As Nyoma, Pandjed, Wayez, and Clash leave the tent, the snow has picked up, drifts solidly accumulating on the ground. They walk back to Phandalin, trying to make sense of Bount's decisions. Their conversation is interrupted by a young girl, carrying a carefully scribed handwritten invitation to dine with the Rose Knight that evening, at her personal camp beside the great tent. </p>\n        <p>That evening - with Kevin watching over Gundren - the four (minus Bount) find themselves eating excellently prepared roast pheasant with Melalonde Rechuviel. She plies them with many questions, seemingly trying to understand herself who they are and why their companion did as he decided to do. At one point, Wayez explains happily, \"Brightheart murdered my liege Queen in cold blood and with extreme malice! That is in fact why I am here with them!\" The Rose Knight chuckles, and responds, \"Well, we Neverwintrians are no strangers to regicide. As someone with old - and thoroughly defunct - royal blood, one must try to take these things in stride.\" At another point, Nyoma tries to bring up the afternoon's plagiarized speech. She attempts to be gentle and collegial, but is trying to figure out whether the Rose Knight is truly a dragon hunter or perhaps whether denying all of those adventurers is some kind of ploy to put things off. But Melalonde bristles at this, insisting on her history as a famed duelist and jouster, her years of experience in combat, and the extreme honor given to her by the leading citizens of Neverwinter in being chosen the noble vanguard for this dragon hunt.</p>\n        <p>Yet despite that momentary friction, the Rose Knight seems companionable, for the most part. After a while, the group is able to determine her intentions. She finds the Flaming Fist boorish and an obstacle, and would be happier and much more at ease if their influence or their presence in the town and in this operation was removed. Rechuviel suggests the group could assist in that, and that she would prove grateful if they could. After some time, and some conversation among the whole group, they decide to spring Bounty of Nonsense from the Fist's captivity as the first step in the plan. </p>\n        <p>At the same time, Bount is shivering in a large metal cage inside a horse pen, trying to keep his balance on horse manure as increasingly large amounts of snow builds on the ground inside the pallisaded Flaming Fist camp. His things sit in a series of bags on the fence of the horse pen. Griff Ironguts brings a stool into the pen, and sits on it, and just looks at Bount for a long, long while. The two eventually have a tense conversation, with Griff seeking to know why Bount has done these things, and Bount alternately taunting or promising the downfall of the mercenary captain. Bount explains how Griff hurt his father, and his whole family, and that Bount knows Griff is a menace, who needs to be removed for the safety of everyone in this world. Griff is unapologetic, and promises to spill Bount's brains on the floor of the tent tomorrow. In time, the mercenary withdraws to the fire in the camp closest to the horse pen. </p>\n        <p>Not too long after this, Bount is surprised to see a sack of thieves' tools floating across the manure and snow toward his cage! It is held aloft by a ghostly hand, and Nyoma and Wayez are peeking over the palisade. Bount \"whispers\" frantically to Nyoma, trying to figure out why they are here - except that the whispers occur at a distance of twenty feet, and are seemingly transmitted directly into the tiefling's brain? In any case, after some debate, Nyoma is able to convince Bount to be freed, in order to further humiliate the Flaming Fist. The tabaxi is able to pick the lock on the cage, hiding the tools when the Flaming Fist guards look over at the pen, and he starts to head out. \"What about your things?\" Wayez whispers. \"Oh, shit,\" says Bount, and turns back. \"Hold on,\" Wayez instructs him, and climbs up and over the palisade. As soon as she hits the ground, she is a horse, and she shields the tabaxi as he grabs his things, making only a little noise as he drops one of his bags but catches it again before it hits the ground. He is momentarily distrated by a sack of stolen loot also on the fence, but in the end, he opts not to try and grab it. Wayez and Bount make their way back to the fence, and climb over. Pandjed is there to meet them, and Nyoma, though she has quite a strange expression on her face. They hurry away. </p>\n        <p><i>Meanwhile…</i></p>\n        <p>Gundren, having run for several miles, stumbles and falls to his knees in a broad fallow field deeply encrusted with snow. Thick clouds blanket the moon in the night sky, and Kevin lands quietly in a large bushy tree not far away. The clouds part, and the immense bulk of a pale white dragon descends from the sky, settling into the snow with a crunch. Gundren prostrates himself in front of the beast, and the scaly creature brings low its long porcelain neck, until the great fang-mawed head of the thing is just next to Gundren's face. The old dwarf is babbling mechanically and at speed, but the wind and the snow steal the words away from Kevin's hearing. The winged giant's face almost seems to be caressing Gundren, until it is apparent that the black mold growth on the dragon's face is extending thin grasping tendrils toward Gundren, seeking his ear. The branch on which Kevin sits, heavy now with snow in addition to the owl, suddenly cracks under his weight. Fast as lightning, the dragon's head snaps straight up and its eyes are fixated on Kevin. The owl launches itself from the branch, wings beating furiously, but the dragon rockets itself into the air, so much faster than should be possible for a creature of that size. The pursuit lasts only a few moments, until the monster's jaws close on the bird, engulfing it totally. Kevin disappears. </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 18) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>The adventurers – Wayez, Pandjed, Bounty of Nonsense, and Nyoma, with Clash trailing behind – walk back to Phandalin through fresh snow, Nyoma's mage hand and Wayez's treaties obscuring any traces they might leave behind. Bount thanks the others for not forcing him to sleep with a pillow of horse manure, to which Wayez replies, \"You do indeed smell terrible, Brightheart!\" Nyoma tells the others what she saw, with Gundren and the White Dragon. They discuss the black mold, and ponder on the seeming impossibility of freeing creatures from it. Wayez is quietly furious, but is clear she is deeply unhappy about \"personal distractions\" leading to them missing a chance to intervene with the dragon. Also, Bounty of Nonsense learns that dragons have lairs.</p>\n        <p>Back in Phandalin, a sudden unusual look comes over Nyoma's face. She changes direction away from the inn, and the others follow her. They head to Clash Enterprises, where Nyoma fixes her eye on the window to Gundren's attic loft, mostly but not entirely obscured by the clapboard side with the smiling goblin face in front of the cottage. The tiefling finds a lattice on the side of the cottage, and begins to climb. Not shortly after, she crashes to the ground, raising a ruckus. There is a matching alarum inside, and the back door flies open, with Gudren in night clothes dashing frantically across the snow, mumbling incoherently.  </p>\n        <p>Nyoma stands and moves her arms in a complicated arc, which culminates in a hand movement much like twisting a dial. The magical energies in the area dampen and are dispelled. Gundren trips, flies face forward, and hits the snow. Something protoplasmic, like an arachnid made of black amorphous muck, climbs out of his ear and begins to attack him! Wayez is already running to intercept, and she reaches out and freezes the protoplasm to a solid chunk. She throws it away and it shatters on the ground.  </p>\n        <p>(While all of this is happening, Bount grabs Clash and pull them both behind a nearby corner. Clash eyes Bount fixedly and says, \"Oh, so now you care about the safety of others..\" Bount notes it with surprise, but moves on for now.) </p>\n        <p>Gundren wakes, coughing and sputtering. A light has returned to his once-glassy eyes, and when he speaks, he seems surprised and confused, but cogent and reasonable. He thanks the group profusely, as they help him back to bed. Wayez profusely and enthusiastically sings the praises of \"Moonspeaker,\" for having finally delivered the solution for how to cure the parasitic corruption. But Gundren also turns to emphatically thank Wayez himself, for directly saving him from the clutches of the protoplasm, at which Wayez visibly beams. With the group standing on the floor of the cottage and looking almost eye-to-eye at Gundren in the small (dwarf-sized) attic loft, he tells them what he remembers.  </p>\n        <p>The \"woman in red\" at Cragmaw Castle brought the muck to infect him, and after that point, he experienced his days as if he was looking out a long, dark tunnel, while someone else did most of the controlling of his body. Gundren describes the voice that initially took control as a calm, cold, confident voice, who acted in the language of strategies and maneuvers. But after a certain point, the controlled voice was replaced by a more bestial figure, more of an instinct than a voice, with the cold voice somewhere distant. Even awake and in control of himself, Gundren tells them he can still feel the presence of the voice, far away but getting closer, getting closer to returning from wherever it went.</p>\n        <p>At last, Gundren confesses exhaustion, and asks to be left to his rest. He thanks the group, and invites them to return in a day or two, so that he might thank them properly. But in response to a question from Pandjed, he initially hands over a box of notes and other scraps he seemed to have scribbled while he was not in control of himself. Pandjed takes them.  </p>\n        <p>The next morning, Bounty of Nonsense's upcoming duel with the Captain Griff Ironguts of the Flaming Fist has the tavern abuzz. Over breakfast, the adventurers discuss how to foment rebellion surrounding the duel, and Pandjed sifts through the notes in the box. He finds many cryptic notes, among them a profile drawing of a decayed town overgrown with trees and vines, with emphasis on a broken tower near the center of town, and a portrait of a man who looks much like Gundren, and next to him a drawing of something that looks much like one of the keys the group has found (albeit with a different, not-yet-seen shape). But before too long, it is time to go and prepare for the duel.</p>\n        <p>Wayez, Pandjed, and Nyoma try to seed the ground for Bount's duel. Nyoma travels from shop to public space to merchant stall, pumping up Bount's image as a man of the people, a protector of the innocent, and a savior of the endangered. Pandjed goes from house to house, intimidating the locals into attending. And Wayez puts a quiet word in with the local sheep, horses, and chickens, ensuring that anyone who has to manage a flock, herd, or group of animals is following those animals to the big tent at the edge of town.  </p>\n        <p>While the trio tries to amp up the town, Bount goes to square things with Clash. It becomes a fight, where Clash accuses Bount of abandoning all the advice he gave to her, about moving on and never looking back and being safe above all, in pursuit of ego and personal vendettas. Bount partially admits the goblin is right, that there is an element of vendetta here, but also tries to make her see that some things are right and some things need to be done. If not for his family, then for everyone else the Fist has hurt. Clash grudgingly agrees to come to the duel, but makes Bount promise he won't let himself get arrested or otherwise abandon the others. </p>\n        <p>Finally, it is noon. Bount is not yet in the tent. Pandjed, Wayez,  Nyoma, and Clash are scattered through the crowd. Pandjed ignores some insistent whispering behind him, trying to get his attention. (As he later discovers, it is the group's old friends, Hamun Kost the Red and Jasper Nine-Fingers.) Griff waits with an evil grin on his face.  </p>\n        <p>After a dramatic delay, Bount sweeps into the tent, and begins a speech: \"I say to you all, is this what you want? The corrupt Flaming Fist to go up against a corrupted dragon? When corruption fights corruption, it is we as the people who suffer. I understand as part of these auditions that we are to speak as to why we should be brought to hunt the dragon. I lay forth the lessons I've learned these education and intense recent months.\" </p>\n        <p>Stepping up to face the crowd, he says, \"To face such a threat, you need to be brave, and you need to remind yourself of such.\" </p>\n        <p>Looking at Wayez: \"To face this, you must maintain a cold front that encases the warmth and kindness that enables the necessary comradery to take anything on.\" </p>\n        <p>Looking at Nyoma: \"To face this, you must know that what is right is not always easy or fair, but no matter how powerful or frightening, your actions and choices can overcome that.\" </p>\n        <p>Looking at Pandjed: \"To face this, you must trust your fate to yourself, your companions, and a little bit of luck. This is a dragon we're talking about.\" </p>\n        <p>Miming flicking a cigarette away and winking slightly at the audience: \"And of course to face this, one must be quick of step.\" </p>\n        <p>Then, looking at Clash: \"But to face this, even if you somehow found the drive to take on a powerful force, it may not be what you want, but with your friends, you know you're in this together, and that is a powerful force unto itself.\" </p>\n        <p>Concluding, he says, \"And to face this, you must learn to adapt. Before. During. After. Any challenge must be overcome with the ability to change yourself, hopefully for the better.\" </p>\n        <p>After this, Griff rips savagely into Bount with retorts, insults, and invective. He says, \"Pretty words, so fitting for an egotistical murderer of dozens! Not just a murderer, but a coward who sends letters that leave good men dead! Don't listen to his silver tongue, it only tells lies. Put your faith in justice, and the Flaming Fist!\" </p>\n        <p>Bount responds sardonically, \"Ah, yes. Instead of putting your faith in me, would you wish to put your hopes of victory into a man and a full camp unable to contain but a 'common criminal,' in his words? A man who could not see through a forgery and then led his own troops to an unknown fate? Make your choice with that in mind, my friends.\"  </p>\n        <p>Griff spits on the ground. \"Enough. Let's do this.\"  </p>\n        <p>The two clash with swords, daggers, and crossbow bolts, dancing back and forth in a complicated gavotte. It is hard to see who has the advantage, but Bount finds himself giving one step, then two, then three. Pressure is mounting, and Griff clearly has no small skill when it comes to to-the-death dueling. After a lengthy exchange of blades, Bount swiftly steps out and away, putting some distance between him and Griff. After Griff misses with another crossbow shot, Bount raises his bow, about to voice some quip about giving as good as he is getting. But suddenly Bounty of Nonsense's arm is wreathed in a strange fire without heat, which coalesces into a strange amalgam of fox fur and turtleshell, covering his arm and engulfing his arrow. When he lets loose with his shot, it is a bolt of magical frost snapping across the battlefield, which Griff is only just able to dodge.  </p>\n        <p>The Fist Captain shouts treachery, that this is cheating, a clear violation of the traditional rules of individual combat! The tabaxi stammers, stunned, unable to conceive what has happened here. Griff calls for his companions seeded through the audience to rise up and arrest the tabaxi. The Flaming Fist soldiers in the audience rise and move toward the ring. He also yells for the people to rise up against the criminal and murderer, but they do not respond so easily. Without Bount saying anything, Pandjed rises from his front-row seat to back up his friend, followed close behind by Nyoma and Wayez. Bount fixes Griff with a stare, saying, \"Let me show you that to face a dragon, you must work together without question or demand. I will demonstrate thusly!\" And then the two groups charge at each other.  </p>\n        <p>It is a pitched battle, with flashing metal and arcing elemental bursts to and fro on both sides. Pandjed falls, but is brought back by Nyoma. Bount carries on his duel with Griff, while the others handle the other Flaming Fist soldiers. Those soldiers fall, one by one, though not without pain and sweat and tears from the adventurers. But at last, Griff finds himself alone on the battle field as Bount continues to hold his own against him, occasionally erupting with new magical blasts despite himself.  Finally, Bount levies his blade at Griff and says, \"You chose an unfair fight. Your companions lie dead, dying, or in flight. Choose to relinquish your arms, or choose to relinquish your fate.\" Griff Ironguts kneels on the ground in submission. Bount steps forward, thrusting with his blade. The tip catches the hook on Griff's hand, and flings it off and away into the dust.  </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 19) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>The Heroes of Phandalin! Bounty of Nonsense and his friends run the Flaming Fist out of town, sparking off an impromptu village-wide celebration and many free drinks for the adventurers. Many assorted hijinks are had against this backdrop. Wayez uses Bount's actual name for the first time! She also tells outlandish stories of bravery and heroism to the townsfolk, causing Pandjed to frown and Bount to blush. Over tea, Gundren suggests they seek out his brother Tharden, who may or may not be at the Lost Mine of Phandelver-slash-Forge of Spells and who may or may not hold one of the keys? (Or this might be a distraction, or the green dragon might be a trap?  Choices, choices!)  At the rowdy Sleeping Giant tavern, Pandjed and Wayez antagonize the ne'er-do-wells Jasper and Hamun, now with their new dragon hunter friends. Nyoma struggles with both sides to keep everything friendly, or at least non-violent, despite her own growing agitation over what a train-wreck the whole situation is.</p>\n        <p>Back in Bount's room at the Inn, Pandjed falls asleep standing up while Bount and Nyoma bicker about the trio's drunken \"negotiation.\" The argument ends with the tabaxi losing his temper, which now apparently comes with a ringing peal of thunder knocking people and things about every which way in the room. Bount is incredulous, initially still unwilling to believe, and later upset. Wayez and Nyoma take turns trying to console Bount about his new-found magic powers. Also, Nyoma learns for the first time that a new Star of Selune has manifested around her eyes! She is mortified not to have thanked Selune properly, and does so at the first opportunity that night.</p>\n        <p>During the night, Pandjed has a curious dream. He finds himself a dwarf, wearing gleaming plate with a violet sash, and wielding Lightbringer, albeit with strange polyhedral bas-reliefs on the sides. The Pandjed/dwarf is in the throes of a pitched melee, inside an enormous hall dominated by a massive upright  artifact-engine-device, shaped vaguely like a coffin, glowing with green eldritch energy inside. The artifact has a vaguely humanoid-shaped opening in the center, and Pandjed/dwarf and his companions seem to be fighting a bloody battle to stop robed, cowled wizards from climbing inside the device? One of Pandjed/dwarf's lieutenants screams a battle cry, \"For the purple rebellion and its righteous cause!\" But they cannot stop all the wizards, for one finds its way into the device. Another lieutenant cries with horror in her voice, \"They're activating it!\" A rumble and sharp light shake Pandjed awake. He is clutching Lightbringer in his bed. The paladin prays for guidance from Savras.</p>\n        <p>The next morning, the group joins the Rose Knight for crepes and breakfast wine. Melalonde confesses to Nyoma that she was right in her original estimation, and that she is terrified right down to her bones of facing the dragon. (She seems to believe there is only one dragon. Is there only one dragon? Or two? Or more? Questions, questions!) The Rose Knight almost begs the adventurers to do something about the dragon, the fear unmistakeable in her eyes. Only then can she return to Neverwinter in the good graces of proper society. She promises to reward them rightly, and to provide any support possible for now. The adventurers request some time to consider their plan.</p>\n        <p>Back in Bount's room once more, there is further debate and discussion. At last, it is decided to carry out an exploratory expedition to the Lost Mine, to see if Tharden Rockseeker is alive and possibly answer some of the remaining questions. The idea of venturing to the possible resting place of the Forge of Spells fills everyone with trepidation. Because of the risk involved, it is decided that Nyoma should pass one of the two keys she has been protecting to someone else, to keep them from possibly being lost together. Pandjed asks for it, and Nyoma hands it to him. He stands for a moment, studying the strangely-colored inscribed polyhedron. In his other hand is Lightbringer. With sudden inspiration, Pandjed brings the two together. As he does so, a magnetic force draws the key swiftly toward the hammer, like a tidal pull. In a flash of light, the key disappears! And Lightbringer sports an unexpected polyhedral bas relief decorating the hammer's head. The hammer continues to glow for two heartbeats, illuminating the shocked faces of the four.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 20) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Wayez, Pandjed, Bounty of Nonsense, and Nyoma embark from Phandalin on a reconnaissance survey of the Lost Mine of Phandelver. They hike out from the now-tranquil town, over rolling hills of increasing elevation, leading up to the upthrust cliffs of the eastern edge of the Sword mountains. Based on where they suspect the entrance to be, it is suspected to be a quick three hour hike. But as they cross a series of low snow-filled ridges, their journey is interrupted as the so far elusive white dragon plummets through the clouds, on a lightning-fast impact course with the adventurers!</p>\n        <p>The beast is massive, covered in blueish-white scales, and held aloft by stunningly large wings that beat powerfully through the air. One of its eyes is covered by the black oily mass the stretches over one side of the face. The delicate-looking leathery wing coverings that draping across the bones of the upper limb billow out as the creature descends rapidly. The dragon flies over the back half of the group - Bount and Pandjed - and unhinges its long, sharp, knife-like jaw as the beast's chest swells with an intake of breath. There is an onslaught of icy death as a spreading cone of ripping, tearing, stabbing projectiles of frost erupts from the dragon's gullet and cracks the earth as it strikes the land. Pandjed is hit first and tries to hold himself upright, taking one step back, then a second, before the storm forces him onto his knees, and finally to unconsciousness. Bount is struck next by the rushing roiling ice, and the tabaxi is picked up and flung several feet away, whereupon he does not get back up. Above all this, one might expect a beastial scream or reptilian hiss. But as the dragon unleashes hell and torment from its throat, it is the very human voice of the Black Spider, Prince Nezznar, that issues forth. It is a manic scream: \"Why won't you LEAVE THIS PLACE? I AM TRYING TO SAVE YOU!\"</p>\n        <p>While this is happening, Wayez stands agape, her mouth hanging open as she stares at the dragon and all its terrible majesty. Nyoma screams, enraged, and channels some of her divinely granted power to snap Pandjed back into consciousness before stalking through the snow after the dragon, throwing bolt and blast of magical energy after it. This snaps Wayez out of her awe-inspired trance, and she turns to her fallen companions, and Nyoma, blinking in the frosty air. The faerie's skin becomes luminous, with the patterns tracing out an image of a chalice, and she speaks an esoteric phrase in Bounty of Nonsense's direction. There is one heartbeat where the tabaxi just lies there, and then another. But finally, he coughs and sputters and rises. Wayez aids Nyoma in the attack on the creature.</p>\n        <p>The dragon does a stunningly quick about turn of more than a quarter in the air, and begins bearing down on Nyoma, seemingly in response to her blasts. Instead of launching another horrid blast on the tiefling, the dragon instead drops down to ground level and plucks Nyoma up in its great claws, before launching itself higher and higher above the treetops. Seeing this, Pandjed immediately takes off at a run, trying to close as much distance between himself and the dragon. The paladin yells out in draconic, \"<i>What do you mean by saving us?</i>\" The dragon slows in the air and shouts back, again in the Prince's human voice but in the clipped grinding tones of the draconic language: \"<i>Magic is a curse. And I will KILL YOU ALL to SAVE you from it!</i>\" The reduction in the beast's velocity is all Pandjed needs, and summoning up the power from the new Jumping Ring on his finger, the dragonborn launches himself over a dozen feet into the air. Pandjed flies up in his jumping arc above the dragon, and brings Lightbringer down on the great creature's side, knocking it down in the sky and jarring Nyoma free from its talons. The white dragon fixes Pandjed a look of rage with its one good eye, but the creature speeds up and away, and escapes. </p>\n        <p>The four stand gasping in the snow a long while, recovering from what just happened. In the end, although shocked and shaken, they decide to move on to the entrance of the Lost Mine. \"At least,\" Nyoma reminds the gunshy group, \"when we're in there, we'll be underground! The dragon won't be able to fly, then! Or so I hope.\"</p>\n        <p>The adventurers eventually find a sizeable lake in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, and a passable trail that climbs up a ridge on one side of the lake that leads to a recently excavated opening in the hill. But they also notice a plume of smoke coming from several hundred meters away, which upon investigation seems to be issuing from a small crack in the rocky earth of the hill. After some musing, they decide to explore this route first. Or, rather, Wayez does, transforming herself into a small spider and skittering down the crack. Eventually she finds her way into a cave room, where an older dwarven man sits at a campfire surrounded by supplies, protected behind an improvised barrier cutting off the room from the rest of the cave system. The man has a certain resemblance to Gundren Rockseeker, though he seems haler and possibly younger compared to the slightly shrunken and wizened Gundren? The faerie returns to her normal form and greets the dwarf, terrifying him half to death. They have a short but strange conversation, where the dwarf is convinced that Wayez is a hallucination and the faerie does nothing to dissuade him. Eventually, the hallucination asks the dwarf for directions out of the cave, and he readily agrees, seemingly fairly eager to be done with the exceedingly eerie situation. Wayez sets out from the cave room, seeking another exit.</p>\n        <p>Meanwhile, the other three decide to explore the open entrance, after waiting a few minutes for Wayez to come back and not seeing or hearing from her. They explore the tunnel that descends downwards, cross a small stream, and find a set of stairs that could be naturally carved or produced by sapient hands, it being difficult to tell. They spot the dancing reflections of a flame held by someone around a corner, impossible to see. Meanwhile, Wayez spots a torch in the distance, and cautiously explores forward toward it. There is a brief light comedy of errors as the three and Wayez attempt to see the other without exposing themselves in the flamelight, which only ends when an ill-judged scraping of Wayez's boot awakes a swarm of pink, fleshy batlike creatures with mosquito-like probosces. There is a short period of chaos as the adventurers fight off the animals - stirges - as the stirges try to latch on for a blood-meal. At one point, one gets caught in Nyoma's hair, and the tiefling reflexively bursts into flame to remove the pest, swinging wildly at it with her quarterstaff. But overall the stirges do not prove a serious threat, and soon enough the group is reunited and able to consider their surroundings. They find themselves in a large cavernous space, with a larger stream that the one they saw before flowing to the south under a rock wall into another space. A few other exits dot the cavern. And on one side of the stream, strangely shaped chunks of rock form a small pile of rubble. Nyoma drops to one knee to sift through the debris. \"They look like an eroded statue of a person,\" she comments. Wayez lets out a sudden gleeful laugh. \"Look! I am a rock who became a person, and this is a person who became a rock!\"</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 21) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>The adventurers explore the caverns further, finding a strange room full of sarcophaguses, replate with strangely posed statues. Wayez is entranced by the idea of opening the \"boxes,\" not entirely understanding the concept of a coffin. But Nyoma, on seeing the statues, pulls the faerie bodily out of the room to prevent her from messing about with things not understood. The group moves on to greet Tharden Rockseeker, Gundren's brother.</p>\n        <p>There is negotiation to get Tharden to open the makeshift door to his literal hidey-hole, and then there is conversation, drinking, and more negotiation around the fire with the dwarf. He looks decades younger than Gundren, but notes he is the older brother? In any case, after some discussion of mining claims and profit and timelines, the adventurers ask about the key drawn on the page. Tharden refers to it as \"a quizzical curio,\" which he found and later lost to some kind of large and nasty blind albino cave lizard. Wayez sells the dwarf her part-share of the mine claim to buy the rights to the lost relic from Tharden, just in case it can be found again.</p>\n        <p>As the characters explore the caves in the direction of where Tharden indicated he lost the key, Bounty of Nonsense's encounter with the ice dragon comes back to bite him. Surprised coming around a corner by a six-legged grey squat reptile (a basilisk, though the adventurers know little more than the name of such creatures), the tabaxi stumbles back, and then cries out in pain as he falls to the ground. The basilisk hisses as Bount falls, and the reptile scurries away down the corridor away from the party. Examining the leg that failed him, under Bount's fur the skin of his knee is mottled, blue-white, and icy chill to the touch. It seems some kind of deep frostburn has set in. Further, staring the basilisk in the eyes caused Bount the oddest sensation, as if his whole body threatened to lock up just for a moment, before dissipating. With the others unable to locate the surprise reptile, the group sets off again. Bount remains the point person, limping as he proceeds.</p>\n        <p>The group comes upon a staggeringly diverse display of bioluminescent lichens, molds, and meter-high mushrooms dimly lighting a vast oblong cavern. Toward one end stands a tall pair of intricately wrought brass double doors, covered in runes, sigils, formulas, and signs from a hundred different languages. One of the doors is pulled open slightly, leaving the entranceway accessible. Nyoma translates the iconography on the door, which seems to be snippets of arcane phrases mixed with the conjugations of the words to be and to make in a thousand different languages. The four wait in silence outside the door for a few moments, pensively staring at the dark entranceway. Then they begin to plan.</p>\n        <p>After everyone takes their positions, Bounty of Nonsense squares up in front of the door. He inhales, and begins to yell, but not in his own voice. Rather, he speaks with the clipped, elegant-yet-strained speech of the Black Spider. He shouts: \"You idiots! Get out here! They have headed SOUTH, away into other parts of the cavern! I won't be facing them alone. Attend to me at once, or I will have your heads!\" There is one moment of silence, then another. Then a third. The four exhale the breaths they've been keeping held in, as nothing happens. That is, until a dart rips out of the darkness to the southwest and buries itself four inches deep into a waist-high mushroom immediately next to Bount. Hobgoblin Iron Shadows attack!</p>\n        <p>The fight with the Iron Shadows is brief, as it seems not all of the mask-wearing night stalkers made it to the battlefield? There are mysterious squelching noises and screams from the tunnel to the southwest from which the iron shadows emerge. During this fight, Wayez becomes as luminiscient as the fungi surrounding her, her body etched with the signs of the Form of the Archer. She begins to cackle maniacally as she fights alongside her companions. And when the last of the hobgoblins falls, Wayez suddenly tears away at a sprint toward the tunnel with the unexplained sounds. Nyoma and Bount try and stop her, although Pandjed simply follows, Lightbringer held at the ready.</p>\n        <p>Wayez bursts into another smaller cave room, with the same stream the adventurers initially encountered here as well, although now running from the east to the west and down a vertical chasm next to a spiral staircase leading down further into the earth. The bodies of two iron shadows are here, and the remains of a pungent and moldering large white cave lizard, its eyes milky and sightless, all heaped underneath a great stalactite descending from the ceiling like a tooth in a maw. And as Wayez emerges into the room, still cackling, a single baleful eye opens on the stalactite, and then a fanged-tooth mouth, and a fleshy tendril launches out of the erstwhile-stone to seize Wayez and drag her toward the monster hanging from the ceiling.</p>\n        <p>The battle continues on, with the adventurers now tangling not with hobgoblins but trying to avoid being pulled into the craw of the rock-monster! At one point, both Wayez and Bount are pulled halfway inside its mouth, as the fanged teeth rip and tear at their armor and exposed skin. Wayez begins bleeding profusely, although her blood looks just like water, and it gives the stalactite-creature the disconcerting appearance of salivating. After a mighty struggle, and several long leaps into the air by Pandjed to strike at the monster with the hammer Lightbringer, the rock-creature is vanquished.</p>\n        <p>Nyoma walks directly to the body of the large lizard, a grim determination etched on her face. She pulls out a knife and begins cutting into the beast's belly. After several minutes of searching, she pulls an arm out of the animal's belly, covered up past the elbow in gore and guts. But in her hand she holds a deep red twelve-sided dodecahedron, covered with intertwined pairs of vine-like inscriptions, bearing scripts native to both the Feywild and the Shadowfell. The third of four keys is now in the adventurers' hands.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 22) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Returning to Tharden Rockseeker's hideaway for a night's sleep before exploring beyond the doors, the group beds down for the night. Nyoma examines the book stolen from the libraries of Candlekeep returned by Nezznar, and discovers it full of intriguing marginal notes about the history and use of the Forge of Spells. It seems that the keys are potentially USEFUL for operation of the Forge, but not necessarily CRITICAL? And that someone must enter the Forge \"bodily\" to operate it? Before sleeping that evening, Nyoma prays to Selune in confusion, desperately seeking guidance on what the group should do next.</p>\n        <img src=\"./images/session_22_marginalia.jpg\" className=\"session-img img-shadow\" alt=\"Session 22 Marginalia\" />\n        <p>Sleeping fitfully around the campfire, Pandjed finds himself beckoned by Savras, and then the adventurers are plunged into a shared too-real dream of things once past in these same caves. They get a look into the downfall of the Purple Rebellion, and how it led to the obliteration of the Phandelver Pact which guarded the Forge of Spells, as well as the loss of the \"Forge-Temple\" to the sands of time. The dream ends as the caverns collapse, whereupon Pandjed and Nyoma find themselves face to face with Savras and Selune. For Nyoma, it is an emotional experience, and Selune embraces her and consoles her. The gods together speak of free will as the gift of all mortals, something that even dieties cannot aspire to, and that the Forge of Spells is itself an instrument of mortal free will, almost built into the fabric of the world itself. That the Forge can do almost anything a mortal wills it to, but whether and how to use it is not the province of Fate or Divine Instruction. The adventurers must choose, or allow the Black Spider to choose.</p>\n        <p>The next day, the adventurers come to terms with the shared nature of the dream and its historical nature. Wayez is panicked, angry and upset, swearing never to let anything or anyone force her to be something or someone else ever again. She is comforted by Tharden, and after a while, the adventurers get prepared to explore the Forge Temple. It is an ancient baroque marvel of carved stone and brass, ruined by roof collapses and upthrust floors caused by the earthquakes long ago.</p>\n        <p>Inside, they encounter an old acquaintance (as prophesied by Savras to Pandjed when he asked for guidance the previous evening): zombie Iarno Albrek! She is teaching a zombified hobgoblin jailer to play the violin, with some progress. Iarno seems as surprised to see the adventurers as they are to see her. She seems bitter and defeated by her experiences with both the Spider and the party. But Nyoma and Bounty of Nonsense are able to leverage her greater hatred of Nezznar for having turned her into her current state. Iarno agrees to help them take Nezznar down, and with a snap of her fingers she sends the jailers on an absurd errand, walking hundreds of miles. After Bount unlocks her cell, she joins the group.</p>\n        <p>Exploring south, the party opens a second set of double doors, and encounters the erstwhile resting place of the Forge of Spells. Filled with a number of smaller forges that seem mundane except for the green glowing flames within them, the space is dominated by a massive dais. In his first prophetic dream three days prior, Pandjed inhabited the persona of the dwarf Obregon Swift and led the climactic final charge of the Purple Rebellion on to this dais, to protect the Forge of Spells which sat majestically on it. But the Forge is not there, replaced with deep furrows leading through a massive collapsed cave wall to the east. What is there on the dais is something akin to a Beholder, if it were made of rough clay, and a flaming skull. They engage the adventurers in conversation, and it becomes apparent they are servitors of the magical artificers who belonged to the Phandelver Pact. Also, they clearly believe the temple is still in operation, and are quite concerned about intruders. The group is able to easily convince them they belong, which is helped by Wayez sporting a tattered purple rag she picked up from a corpse in the outer caverns.</p>\n        <p>Following the claw-like scratches in the dais and the deep furrows in the earth through the collapsed cave section, the adventurers discover a great gaping hole, over which a stream of water tumbles, forming a misty waterhall. The hole extends down into blackness, easily a hundred feet deep in the dark Forge-Temple. Around the edge of the maw can be seen another rocky outcropping, and this one with a rope ladder leading down! After some debate over how to get across the gap to the other rocky outcropping, with options including Wayez-as-spider or hand-over-hand rope traversal, the group decides to turn back to seek another way.
